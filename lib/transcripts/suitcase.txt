Speaker1: Ohh OK.
Speaker2: Let me.
Speaker1: Anymore, OK.
Speaker1: Gonna have you sent the green chair doesn't move.
Speaker1: Appreciate you coming in. Yes, ma'am. And I want to ask you about the room. We have a moment. Sure.
Speaker1: So obviously, um, he received his autopsy. So I'm going to read you your rights again because I we have to talk about that. And since I'm talking about the incident, we just have to do it just like we did yesterday. Just like we did yesterday. Remember, I read you the rights, right? Yeah, exact same thing. But since I'm asking you follow up questions, I need to read them to you. OK. All right. So you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you in court. You're the right to talk to a lawyer before and during questioning.
Speaker1: All charge. If you cannot afford a lawyer and want one, one can be provided for you before questioning without charge. Has anyone threatened you or promised you anything to get you to talk to me? No. And do you understand why I just read you? Perfect. OK, so this morning we went to his tree.
Speaker1: And we were informed of some injuries that he has by the doctor, so I want.
Speaker1: Um, so he's got.
Speaker1: Scratch marks to his back. I know what that's from. OK and um.
Speaker1: It's called a contusion. Do you know contusion is so like basically you're getting hit and then you know you you get a mark from it, you'll get bruising.
Speaker1: Like someone hit you or something like that. It's called a contusion. So he had some injuries to his left shoulder.
Speaker1: He had. He had a cut near his like lip. We could see, we could see his his mouth was a little. I haven't landed yet on him, OK, I also too I he fell off my son's bike. OK, so I don't know. And he's notorious for running into the wall or the hall tree. So why?
Speaker1: OK, I don't what about the scratches?
Speaker1: Because there's also sex, yes. OK, because there's also like, uh, like a scratch on like the back of his neck. Like kind of like going, but it's like going straight across.
Speaker1: I have no idea what that's wrong. And they're all recent. Like they they they occurred recently. It wasn't something that occurred post or that occurred a week ago or two days ago. Three days ago, they definitely occurred, you know, the night leading up to when he was. In all honesty, all honesty, we have not gotten into it, OK? That's why, like the only thing I thought you guys were going to ask me about, which I was going to be honest with you anyway, are the scratch marks when it's back, everything else. I have no idea what it is.
Speaker1: No idea what it is. Nonetheless, I've had my son over the house too, so.
Speaker1: Well, your son was theirs when? When was he last there? Ohh gosh my understanding he was there like last Tuesday last. I don't know if it was Tuesday.
Speaker1: But yeah, she was there last week, so. Well, we're talking about Sunday. Yeah, we're making. We're just talking about what occurred Sunday because like I said, the injuries are.
Speaker1: They occurred within that time period, so you talking about day before yesterday?
Speaker1: Sunday leading into Monday.
Speaker1: You called us yesterday at one so, but the incident you guys were painting and stuff the night prior, correct? So we're talking about Sunday. And then why? Thoroughly confused because we had a good time sitting on the back porch having wine and smoking a couple of cigarettes and then decided to go inside and literally paint, do puzzles.
Speaker1: And play and listen to music, that's why.
Speaker1: Nobody got out of sorts that this is what's.
Speaker1: Mind blowing to me like I don't. I have no clue. Nobody laid a hand on anybody he also had.
Speaker1: Like on the left side of his forehead he had basically bruising and on.
Speaker1: I'm like his head, his skull. I have no idea. As if something hit him I consider not for touch, I have not touched him. I have not touched him.
Speaker2: How would you get those?
Speaker1: Injuries. Tell me we'll both know.
Speaker1: I have not touched him yesterday when we took photographs of your overall body and they did, the buccal swabs, did they go under your fingernails? No. OK are you willing to let us absolutely swab underneath your fingernails? Go for it.
Speaker1: OK, I have no idea and I don't want to seem out of sorts, but I have no idea. We had a good day. It was a good day. We've had good days lately, even considering everything that's going on with our jobs and life in general and ex wives and everything.
Speaker1: It's been good. Like I don't even know where this is coming from.
Speaker1: Yeah, I don't even watch physical. Was probably you said, I think what, a month ago where you got the injury right, what you said that was after weeks, give or take. Yeah, a few weeks. That was the last like physical altercation between the two of you.
Speaker1: A month ago we hit you with a curtain rod. Yeah, that's why I can't. Maybe you guys didn't take that either.
Speaker1: Wow.
Speaker1: Like we've been good. I don't know if like it since the last time he got out of jail. Like we've been good and he's been having his classes and his seeing his probation officer, who's amazing.
Speaker1: So.
Speaker2: What do you mean by good? What's your definition of good?
Speaker1: The Commission officer.
Speaker2: No, no, you said you guys have been good. What's your?
Speaker1: Definition I've been good.
Speaker1: I don't think you all understand. He comes at me all the time. He comes at me.
Speaker1: So it's either I flee or try to go upstairs and go to sleep. That's usually what it is. And I don't know if you talked to Brian about any of that, but most of the time when I sleep, I go over there.
Speaker1: So.
Speaker1: Right. But you're saying that you guys have been good and when I asked you yesterday, there hasn't. The last incident that you could remember was the curtain rod incident, which you said was a month ago. So give or take, right? So what do you mean by he comes after you like he gets?
Speaker1: Belligerently drunk like I don't know if you all have looked through my phone yet and see many of the pictures and the videos that I have taken and the at one point I started documenting everything. OK, so you all will see in my pictures.
Speaker1: Bloody fingers, split foreheads. He split my nose. I've got this, right? I don't know, Brian told you about it, where I had to have almost what? I had one really bad surgery, but then it got really, really, really, really bad where I had to go like four or five more times afterwards for them to tend to it from him poking me in the back of the leg. Right. So it's.
Speaker2: Then why are you still with him?
Speaker1: Everybody asked me that when I tell you guys this.
Speaker1: I really love him like I do, and I feel like I can help him. Like I feel like I could help him, which I did, because he's come a really. He came a really long way from where he was and Philadelphia to moving back to here and to dealing with everything else that he's been dealing with. I've really helped him. I've bailed him out of jail what three times. I've gone to every single hearing and every single arraignment. Everything that I did for him, gone to see all his public defender as go to the state. I've gone to the state.
Speaker1: I I did everything for him because I'm trying to help him because I have a I had hope in him and he was trying.
Speaker1: This is really trying.
Speaker1: And then he starts to think about things and it just, I think he gets overwhelmed and then it's like the next thing I know he's drinking. So it's like, ohh man, I know where this is going to go. So I'm going to go upstairs and read a book or I'm going to go for a bike ride or I'm going to do something else where I don't want to drink, I don't want to drink the occasional wine, whatever. Or if it's a weekend, that's when you you have a good time. You don't have to wake up the next day. I have to wake up the next day and do things.
Speaker1: I have to tend to Lucas. I've been taken to school. I have all this stuff to do.
Speaker1: He doesn't know how to.
Speaker1: I guess maintain himself where I can do 50 things at once and still know the 50 things more previously prior that I need to get done. He can't process like that. He didn't process like that so it he would literally, not literally, but had smoke coming out of his ears. So the next thing you know he doesn't want to deal with it.
Speaker1: I'm gonna go get something to drink, so the majority of the time I would hang out outside or do something else because I don't wanna drink.
Speaker1: And every time. Every time.
Speaker1: His job broke his heart and it made me sad because he had so much pride in his job.
Speaker1: And store that he took care of so much.
Speaker1: Totally went downhill and that.
Speaker1: Broke his heart because he had put so much work and effort into fixing it up and his manager was.
Speaker1: Awful.
Speaker1: And basically gave up on all of the employees. So I think that had a huge bearing on why he would drink so much.
Speaker1: His ex-wife is bonkers. She was all over him all the time. Send me money. Send me money. Send me money.
Speaker1: How can I send you money when I don't have a job and he's still trying to take care of me and Lucas? By paying a bill here or there, getting some groceries. So he always had something on his mind, which is why, again, I got the buttholes and the bank to try and get him off of it so we don't have a drink or he doesn't have a drink. So when you all see my phone you can see all of the damage he has done to me and the videos of him smashing my television.
Speaker1: Because he's belligerently drunk.
Speaker1: Where most of the time I just don't want to be there and I try to help him. I try to calm him down.
Speaker1: Eventually he just passes out.
Speaker2: Sarah.
Speaker1: Well, yesterday I made it sound like you guys were just drinking like a glass or two. Like, yeah, you obviously had the bottle. But you, I mean, you told me on the yeah, but you told me on recording like that you were not drunk. He was not drunk. You guys were having a good time. I don't get, I can't get drunk. I never one. I do not want to get drunk.
Speaker1: I don't like being non competitive, having my wits about myself. I don't like feeling out of control.
Speaker1: So I'm just saying you're you're making it sound like like he's a raging alcoholic today. And yesterday I was kind of asking you those questions. And you're like a little defensive like no, we're not Alcoholics. He I'm not. We are not, you know, but you guys are both sober on Sunday to your knowledge. Because when I said you went and passed out, you were like, no, I didn't pass out, I just fell asleep. So now it's kind of like, what is it? Were you guys drinking and it got out of hand?
Speaker1: No, it got physical, nor is it.
Speaker1: Sunday was one of the better days that we have had in quite some time. He's dancing with my dogs. You can see that too on the picture of him loving the dog. He loves the dog and dancing around, having a good time and just.
Speaker1: Just being happy kind of thing.
Speaker1: He doesn't know. I can't.
Speaker1: I mean I can get like.
Speaker1: Maybe two or three glasses of wine and I'll be fine. But I have to have my wits about myself because I don't know what to expect. Well, let's talk about Sunday. What was Sunday? How were you? Like, how many glasses of wine did you have? How many glasses of wine did he have? The bottle was gone. I mean, I don't know if you poured any out. Yeah, no, that was from previous. You said that there was a hot bottle leftover.
Speaker1: And then, um, that you had went that well. I don't even know how the wine. How did you guys get the wine for Sunday? I'm guessing he went to Publix. He's does he do the does he like leave the house and you stay home or do you go to Publix like because you talk about them? OK did you go with him Sunday to Publix? So most of the time what happens is because the convenience store where we get cigarettes is here and then Publix literally is cattywampus to it. So what he'll do is he'll start.
Speaker1: Stop by Publix and then on the way back catch the convenience store so that what he did Sunday. I I'm guessing that's what he did because the next thing I know he's walking in with bottle. OK so that's.
Speaker1: That's him trying to be nice so I don't have to go out and do it. Plus there's stuff that around the house that I had to take care of, so that's usually what will happen. Or I'm folding laundry and he'll go run out and do whatever.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker1: So where were you guys at on?
Speaker1: On drunkenness not drunkenness on Sunday.
Speaker1: I told that you weren't drunk. No, I was not drunk. I was not drunk.
Speaker1: So with him, I don't know.
Speaker1: I know when it's like OK man, where I have told him.
Speaker1: Slow down. It's starting to catch up with you. Slow down, slow down.
Speaker1: And another thing too is I don't like listening to music with him because he gets too involved in the music and the music that he listens to is.
Speaker1: A little rough around the edges and like, just it makes me fractious listening to his music, so.
Speaker1: Kicked him out. How many times I had him arrested? How many times?
Speaker1: I kept asking them, let's not let's just you and me talk. You and me will just be the ones that are talking, which was fine because I mean he we were playing with the dog, whatever. And then it's like, OK, now let's do the painting. We just did the puzzle, took a break, now let's do this.
Speaker1: Sure enough, that dance, we're sitting in there talking, laughing, talking about new movies. We're watching movie trailers.
Speaker1: While we're doing painting and all that other stuff. So it's still background noise to him because I think that's what he's used to, is having background noise where me I can sit and hear all day with not a peep, but he always has to have some kind of background noise, which I didn't mind because the trailers were cool and he was interested in showing them to me.
Speaker1: Getting excited about movies that were out or upcoming? OK, so in your laptop you're talking about and I mean.
Speaker1: And then it.
Speaker2: We.
Speaker1: It was. You said it was a good day, like you guys didn't have any.
Speaker1: Have any conversations about your relationship? You guys didn't go down like the rabbit hole like had too many to drink and you guys start getting Nope. When I tell you this it made me so happy that he actually listened to what I had to say with just we'll get through it. This will be fine. It's just it's it's a small hurdle that you and I together will get through because in turn out the money, jobs, dollars, yes. Nothing.
Speaker1: Relationship wise though, like no issues. Relations. Like, did you guys have a conversation about your relationship or was it just about just like what's going on right now? I try to evoke it from him so he gets it off his chest because I call him the volcano where eventually he's going to erupt, right? And what he has learned in his classes is to communicate, which is a huge thing in a relationship where he has been practicing communication. So he actually talks to me.
Speaker1: About things and unburdens himself. Put it on me. I'll sit there and try and figure it out for you. Like I have almost everything. Not a worry. Just tell me. Get it out of you. Right. But it was when I tell you I was so happy. Like it was such a good day. I kid you not. The weather was beautiful outside. I'm the one that had him go inside so we can do puzzles and painting and listen to music or whatever else he wants to do. So then he starts doing whatever it is we're doing together.
Speaker1: In the living room.
Speaker1: And then start talking because I think he gets comfortable with OK, you know what, we're here. It is a good day. Let me go ahead and explain myself. So I know. Nobody else knows, but I know.
Speaker1: Nobody knew George better than I did. I say that I knew George better than himself.
Speaker1: And I tried in every way shape and form.
Speaker1: Ask everyone.
Speaker1: I helped him.
Speaker1: I took care of him.
Speaker1: I miss him a lot and I didn't even sleep last night.
Speaker1: I miss him a lot.
Speaker1: I mean, is there any chance it got to be too much for you and you couldn't handle taking care of him? And I never stopped wearing them. I never stopped.
Speaker1: That's what I'm here for.
Speaker1: I never stopped.
Speaker1: I'm here now. I'll give. I'm still trying to help him. Yeah. We just don't. I mean, it's unexplainable how he got these injuries and I had no idea you were the only one with him. 100% right hand to God. I had no idea how he got them.
Speaker1: Nobody touched anybody, nobody touched anybody.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker1: You had mentioned that you take you would take photos, videos, kind of like a proof and just in general. Yeah, I heard documenting at one point, but that was that was way before I think the last time that he got arrested where he was flying off the deep end.
Speaker1: But then I had him bailed out. I got him out of jail, right? But because he had violated the pretrial diversion.
Speaker1: But this time it's probation, so you don't have a choice in it. You have to go to see your probation officer. You have to go to.
Speaker2: These classes.
Speaker1: It's court ordered. Umm where it took him a while to get used to it and understand they're not messing around. I even went down and met his probation officer, which I say I she she's wonderful. That's one of my questions. Do I need to talk to you about?
Speaker1: Hugged me and said how much she knows that I take care of him. She called me personally one time when George was at work, when he was working 42 minute phone call. She and I just saying how grateful she is that George has me and she knows how hard I'm working to help him, just as she is and just as the classes will. So once you started actually going on a regular basis to the probation officer and then to his.
Speaker1: Substance abuse class and his I don't know what IP stands for Matters intervention program.
Speaker1: And actually, listening to what it is, everyone had to say he changed like I could. I could see a change in him or before lashing out, he would think about it.
Speaker1: And would always come home and show me his papers and we would look over his papers together. Or it's like, wow, you actually are learning this in class.
Speaker1: And some of the stuff that they would show them, like videos, he would come home and be like, Sarah, I'm so sorry for what I've done to you because.
Speaker1: Or a video that he watches to.
Speaker1: Make him feel that way, where it's like, oh man.
Speaker1: I have done her wrong.
Speaker1: But he's changed. He changed.
Speaker1: And that's why you're still with them, even though he's done all these things to you. And when I tell you I love him, I love him.
Speaker2: Even when you have, when you love somebody, you have limits.
Speaker1: Everybody tells me that. Ohh my neighbors don't tell me that. The Office property manager.
Speaker2: At some point, somebody.
Speaker2: Get enough? Then they have to to do something to defend themselves.
Speaker1: I would just flee and I don't know if you would like to see on my phone or I think it's. I think it's actually on a laptop.
Speaker1: I actually because and you have to understand too. I have like prior to classes in PO.
Speaker2: But he also went down and.
Speaker1: I know.
Speaker2: The next day.
Speaker1: I know what's on your laptop.
Speaker1: Was I going to tell you?
Speaker1: Ohh.
Speaker1: Previously.
Speaker1: I actually looked up how to file a restraining order, OK, because I would kick him out his parents because of them constantly having to take him back in his bags of clothes, all his stuff.
Speaker1: The one time, the last time their father came out and.
Speaker1: Irate and just not even, I don't even know if he knew Lucas was in the car, just opened the back of my car and just started throwing all his crap and just throwing it. Like throwing it like the car would jostle. He was throwing all this stuff.
Speaker1: At that point, because I continually did it, not continually. I think I maybe did it three times and he has nowhere else to go. They got fed up and said Nope, either you're staying there or you're staying here. But if you're staying here at their place, it's permanent. You're not going back over there anymore.
Speaker1: So what happens is he pursues me. So I don't know if you all know where Katie Wade Trail is. OK, so we it's literally right right there from our apartment.
Speaker1: Were riding bike to work but before he would leave extra early and come up to the wall, staying on top of his bike and poke his head over because even though that I would be outside having my morning cigarette and cup of coffee.
Speaker1: Where? And I would also know too what time he would get off of work, where I would know come getting off of work. He's gonna do the same thing. So it's not like I ever got like a break from him where I told you all yesterday or whatever it was.
Speaker1: I started to feel that it was too much togetherness. And when you have too much togetherness, friction happens. So I'm gonna go ride my bike, I'm gonna go upstairs and read a book. But what he every what does he say? Every waking moment he wants to be with me, so.
Speaker1: And mind you, our townhome is either upstairs or downstairs. So it's like if you would like to sit downstairs and watch a movie or play on the laptop, look at some jobs you're more than welcome to. I'm just going to be upstairs, maybe watching one of my shows or maybe reading the book, so and then when that would happen?
Speaker1: We really needed that. So what's for dinner?
Speaker1: And then we would cook together.
Speaker1: And eat dinner and then crawl on the bed and watch a movie.
Speaker1: About this is like recent, I don't you kind of like lost me like what are you talking about? Like like a little while ago but now you're talking about now you're talking about tension building up and that you need space. So have you been feeling that way lately or no?
Speaker1: OK my thing is too so you wanna know ohh I hate that you can't talk to her but.
Speaker1: Um, did his ex-wife, when I say a monster, she's a monster. Like it does. She withholds her, their children from speaking to him. So he gets upset about that and then she's like completely berates him about money, about the father that he is, what he did to her, all this other stuff.
Speaker2: Shutting down?
Speaker1: It doesn't matter. I mean, mind you, this is not like been recent, but which is why he didn't even bother calling anymore, because he knows that he's gonna answer and he's gonna have to talk to her. So therefore he can't talk to his daughter.
Speaker1: The other time he talked to her mate made her talk to Cookie. That's on my cell phone too, so you can see it. It doesn't matter like.
Speaker1: It doesn't matter.
Speaker1: What does she have to do though, with anything about what happened Sunday and into Monday? Like no, I'm just saying like previously, why the incidents would happen is she plays a big part in it alright on that job and money and groceries and all that. OK, Sunday.
Speaker1: I tell you this, I have no idea. I have no idea.
Speaker2: Is there anybody else at the house?
Speaker1: And it's just me and him.
Speaker1: Umm.
Speaker1: Since talking yesterday, do you remember any like time timelines better? Like what time?
Speaker1: You guys were playing what time you he was zipped up in the.
Speaker1: Luggage. What time you have stairs? We started because we had we cleaned the house a little bit, did some wandering. You started the activities around 4. You said yes around 4430 ish. And then you just said that it was dark when you were playing hiding seek. And I'm just curious if you remember, but when we were outside, that's where we would start and talk about things and then eventually I was the one that had him come inside.
Speaker2: So we could do you remember what time that was? Is what she's asking.
Speaker1: And you said you went to, you went up to bed around midnight, midnight and fell asleep around 12:30 ish. But those were the only times I have. So I have 4:00 and I have midnight. So there's a big gap. So I'm just curious, like if you recall when you went upstairs to hide in the shower or like, when we started to play hide and seek? Yeah.
Speaker1: Well.
Speaker1: We went inside, probably about.
Speaker1: If I had to guess, they were we were out there too long, maybe about 6 ish.
Speaker1: Then you talk about from hand outside and like, OK, well, we have two beach chairs that are out there, right. Just enjoy the weather country. Plus it's starting to get dark and Nats and mosquitoes. Yeah. So let's go inside. I don't want to be out here anymore. OK. All right, let's go. So we're doing whatever. We did it for a while because that puzzle, I don't know if they took it or they saw it.
Speaker1: Worked on the puzzle again. Finished it. Started to paint well, started listening to music for a little bit.
Speaker1: Started pain. Can we turn the music off? No problem. Start at the top, paint, whatever.
Speaker1: Maybe.
Speaker1: Gosh, that puzzle the virtual map for probably a good hour and a half.
Speaker1: So 8:00 o'clock ish.
Speaker1: Is when you went to hide upstairs.
Speaker1: Originally, no, that's when we were like, painting. So then it's like, OK, well I we can't. I don't want to paint anymore. Let's just ah, come on.
Speaker1: OK, you wanna play and see what he does is OK, tag, you're it. Well, she's like, OK, we know, OK, take off. That's what we did. And then you went upstairs and then he didn't come up and you came down and the suitcase was there originally because you guys were planning to do donations, so it was already there.
Speaker1: What? You guys ever played the you said you played hide and seek, like probably three times in your relationship when you have played. Have you ever zipped him up in a suitcase prior? No. OK. So it was just kind of like that prop was there and it was there and it was in play because.
Speaker2: What do you say it like that though?
Speaker1: I would never do that.
Speaker2: Your numbers up, them up in a suitcase.
Speaker1: I mean, we were playing. No, I know, but I'm but I'm saying I'm, I'm talking about I didn't seek, which is a game. So the suitcase originally is in our closet, buried all the way to the back. If you don't, I know the CSI people saw our closet. Our closet needs to be cleaned out really bad. My sons clothes need to be cleaned out really bad because they don't fit him anymore and I'm tired of looking at him. So he took it upon himself, including that suitcase.
Speaker1: To take it downstairs so we can get all of our clothes, our donations and everything and just leave the whole thing by the clothing and shoe thing at my son's school. No, we're just. I'm just asking out of the in the past, like, have you ever zipped him up in anything, jokingly or not? But obviously I understand, you know, you're claiming that Sunday, it was a joking matter. You were laughing, he was laughing. But what I'm just asking is in the past, like if it's something that you guys normally do.
Speaker1: Absolutely not, OK.
Speaker1: Um, we were actually this last game running out of places to hide because we have a townhome where it's upstairs or downstairs, so.
Speaker1: Um, OK, so do you remember making any videos or maybe having any cover, anything, any photos, videos that you remember doing on your phone on Sunday?
Speaker1: No, no.
Speaker1: I think I took a picture of a dog. OK, but your phone is password protected. You have the password, he has the facial recognition. So it's not like someone else could be on your phone. No, I have both. But you have the face and the password. Yeah, but he only has the face, correct? No, to be able to get onto your phone. You told me that he looks at the phone. Oh, I misunderstood. I thought you were asking if I did. Yes, it's me. OK. Does he have access to your phone? Because you said it's OK. How does he have access? Sarah, can I buy your phone?
Speaker1: Yeah, it's right there on the kitchen counter. OK, but how did you get into it? Because it's password protected. So he'll come and get it to me. I'll just do the face thing where sometimes too, like, he's like, he'll jug with me and say, OK, I need to borrow your phone and he'll hold up while I'm cooking or doing something, do the facial recognition. OK, so he doesn't know the password and he doesn't have the facial recognition. No, he is the only other person that would use your phone. I'm assuming others. Well, Lucas, right. But Lucas wasn't there Sunday, right?
Speaker1: So do your recollection. No videos on Sunday. Not that I'm aware of. OK? I mean, I like I get maybe take a picture of them, the two of tests and the dogs and George and have them dancing. But I mean, or it's just tests.
Speaker1: OK, um, so I have something that I want to show you that we found um and it was from your phone.
Speaker2: You do?
Speaker2: If you need to move it around, go ahead.
Speaker2: Sarah.
Speaker1: No, I don't remember that for everything you've done to me.
Speaker1: For everything you've done to your batteries about that.
Speaker1: The battery doesn't last very long.
Speaker2: It used to last a lot longer than that. I don't know what.
Speaker1: Happened. OK, let me just grab something, alright.
Speaker2: I was just simply asking because you had a look on your face when she asked you if you've ever done that before. You look kind of shocked and.
Speaker1: No.
Speaker2: OK, but why did you say it like that, like?
Speaker1: I don't think you all understand who I am. Where.
Speaker2: Will tell me.
Speaker1: I mean, I've always been a straight A student. I am an outstanding mother to my son. I excel at everything.
Speaker1: I.
Speaker1: I would not do that.
Speaker2: You wouldn't let somebody in a suitcase.
Speaker1: Well, I didn't like completely lock it. I mean, I opened it with one finger. I left enough in there for him to get out.
Speaker1: And I wasn't planning on going upstairs and going to sleep.
Speaker2: No, it's just the way you said it.
Speaker1: You're scaring me.
Speaker1: We just want to watch. This came from your phone. Don't you want to know what's on it? Yes, please.
Speaker1: Is it long? Because I don't know how much I can take.
Speaker1: I don't know how much I can take.
Speaker2: I don't know how to find her.
Speaker1: Do I have to watch this?
Speaker1: I continuously throw up. I don't sleep. I don't want to see it if that's OK.
Speaker1: Well, it's on your phone.
Speaker1: And you can either explain it or we take it for what it is.
Speaker2: Yeah. We're just trying to give you the opportunity to tell us what's going on. That's it.
Speaker1: It's that long 2 minutes for everything you're doing to me.
Speaker1: For everything you've done to me.
Speaker1: Fuck you.
Speaker1: That's you, your voice, stupid.
Speaker1: That's my name. Don't wear it out.
Speaker1: I can't talk.
Speaker1: Yeah, that's when you do when you check me.
Speaker1: I don't wanna watch that, please.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker2: Last, last time we talked to you, you said that you put them in the suitcase. You had two fingers hanging out.
Speaker1: And you put them over.
Speaker1: I flipped them over and that's where it was.
Speaker2: Two different videos and a still picture where, yeah, it shows you flipping them in different positions and him saying that he can't breathe and you're saying.
Speaker1: This is upside down. So in order for him to have gotten into it, it was flipped up, right? It was flipped up normal, like as if you're packing something. So this is upside down, guys. This is killing me right now. So this image is upside down and then this small video that occurred 11 minutes.
Speaker1: Later it's flipped over the other way.
Speaker1: Closer to your dining room table. Now, he's obviously still in there, so he didn't. How did that? How did it go from the back to the front? I flipped it, OK.
Speaker1: My plan was not to go upstairs and go to sleep.
Speaker1: Well, that's what you did. Yeah, but not intentional one. No, you told me you went upstairs because what, you were getting ready for bed stopped here, OK.
Speaker2: But here.
Speaker1: Show me where you can see any fingers coming out, because there's the end.
Speaker1: It's in his head right here. Hmm. So going like this rather than going all the way up, it's like this.
Speaker1: But why is he saying I can't breathe? And why is he pushing on it as if he can't get out?
Speaker2: And it doesn't show a.
Speaker1: Whole there's no hole. There's no fingers. I don't see his fingers. There's no hole. I don't know what you want me to tell you. Like, I don't know. Like what you want me to tell you. I'm just showing you. I'm just telling you what we see and what we've heard from the other. Yeah, I understand. He's begging to let for you to let him out.
Speaker1: You sound you're laughing in the beginning and then in the end it sounds kind of like a no. It's not malicious.
Speaker2: Well saying. Fuck you.
Speaker1: It's not malicious.
Speaker2: Then what is that?
Speaker1: What is fuck you mean to you?
Speaker1: Well, like if you were to, if I were to tell, like he does, like I get called everything but a white woman. So OK, I my intention was not to leave him in there.
Speaker1: Please understand that my intention was not to leave him in there, but you went upstairs thinking that he could get himself out. But the video shows.
Speaker1: That's why I told you when I see his fingers out there any minute.
Speaker1: And then 30 minutes later, he didn't show.
Speaker2: And he's telling me and I can't make God, do you think he's joke?
Speaker1: You told me he was laughing and I we were before video. There's there's no first got in there.
Speaker1: Both of us were. So how long was he in there for? Like this video is at 11:12 when it starts. So was he in there for like a long time prior to knowing this? No.
Speaker1: No.
Speaker1: So it goes from funny to no longer funny, but you're the only one laughing. But I didn't think that he.
Speaker1: Was like panicky, like I didn't I? So pushing up on a suitcase, saying Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, I can't breathe.
Speaker1: George has done that in the past before too, where it's just like he thinks that he's well with me kind of thing. Where it's like I don't. He's never been locked in a suitcase, but no, he couldn't get out. So it's kind of. I thought it was a boy of oxygen, howling wolf, crying wolf kind of thing. OK, and again, my plan. But nowhere in there is he laughing. Is he joking? He is begging.
Speaker1: And you're the only one laughing, OK? And you're the only one saying derogatory comments like you're mad. No, please don't. I don't mean to sound negative and I don't know if I can say this, but like, it's like you guys are kind of trying to, like, feed me. Like, no, I'm just trying to show you a video that you no longer want to watch because you probably don't want to know the outcome of how and what you said. Well, I know what.
Speaker1: You know you know what's on that video now? No, you remember making that video. Ohh why don't you remember making the video? Probably because we had been drinking, but you weren't drunk.
Speaker1: Just because I went upstairs and just because you're wrong doesn't mean that.
Speaker2: You that you were not drunk. You said that you had your way about you. You said he had his wits about you. You said that you don't like not having your wits and my experience if somebody cannot remember doing something to the extent of making two videos and video and taking a photo.
Speaker2: They are intoxicated.
Speaker1: OK, I understand where you are coming from. Well.
Speaker2: We're just trying to make sense of it. We're trying to figure out.
Speaker1: We're trying to figure out.
Speaker2: This video is going to us. We're listening.
Speaker1: I just did like we were playing and then like I thought it was.
Speaker1: My plan was not to go upstairs and go to sleep. My plan was not to he'll be up here any minute. But you willingly went upstairs and went to sleep. No one forced you to go upstairs, and my name wasn't also to leave him in the suitcase.
Speaker1: So why didn't you take him out? Because I went upstairs and then I fell asleep. But why didn't you consciously think?
Speaker1: He's asking to come out. He didn't do it intentionally.
Speaker2: What do you think is going to happen if you leave somebody in a confined space like that?
Speaker1: Well, I thought by not filling it up all the way it would be OK. My plan was not to leave him in the.
Speaker2: Subway.
Speaker1: Waiting for him to come upstairs.
Speaker2: And then?
Speaker1: When he did it.
Speaker1: I fell asleep.
Speaker2: You said you were up there 30 minutes, after 30 minutes, somebody not coming up.
Speaker1: Knowing that you that the last time you saw him was in the UK 30 minutes later, you're like, hmm, maybe I should go check on him. Maybe I shouldn't. No.
Speaker1: Well, you need that didn't cross your mind because like that's like an assumption. Like that's what you are thinking just.
Speaker2: We're asking. It's the whole tell us.
Speaker1: It's the drinking.
Speaker1: That's what it is.
Speaker1: It's the drinking.
Speaker1: I thought it was like I thought he was OK. Like I didn't. But you.
Speaker2: Are telling you he's not. He's telling you, Sarah, I can't breathe. He's saying your name and you're like, that's my name, don't wear it out.
Speaker1: Guys, that's how we are with each other like he has.
Speaker1: Nobody understands our relationship. This the whole suitcase thing.
Speaker1: Never happened before. Would you leave someone else in the suitcase? Would you leave Lucas in a suitcase jokingly. Because it was a joking matter. You put him in there jokingly. Would you leave Lucas jokingly in there? And you love Lucas, right? And you do that to him either. I wouldn't do that to him. So I just well, it sounds like, again, I don't think you all understand. Like, it's.
Speaker1: I mean, it's not my. That was not my intention.
Speaker1: Y'all don't have any idea what I've done for.
Speaker2: Him but by your acts, and that's exactly right. You get to the point where you've done so much for somebody and they don't show you any appreciation.
Speaker1: He did.
Speaker2: Not by by your words in the video. I don't get that. Because you bring up the fact that when he's choking you, you can't breathe. That's how you felt when he cheated on you. You couldn't breathe.
Speaker2: And you verbally several times told him just fuck you. Well, you said it in the.
Speaker1: Video let us play the rest of it. You don't. And you when I say cheating, it's on his phone.
Speaker2: Cheating is cheating. I think so too. Exactly.
Speaker1: It's your definition of cheating though, so I mean that's what the word cheat means.
Speaker2: And that's what you told him in the video? That I couldn't breathe when you cheated on me?
Speaker2: No, that's how I felt when he said Sarah, I can't breathe.
Speaker2: And you told me.
Speaker1: This is.
Speaker2: What would you say if somebody told you that they had done this?
Speaker1: Someone.
Speaker2: Is that somebody in the suitcase and went up and went to bed.
Speaker1: Do you all not think so? You all think that it's like, ohh good, I got him in there. Now I'm gonna go to sleep. Is that what you guys are trying to assume?
Speaker1: Or trying to like we're just the video.
Speaker1: Is very portraying of the opposite of what you told us. It does not, it is not leading up, it is not matching what statement you gave us in the car. So and that's why we want to know and I don't remember doing those. The injuries are not consistent with what you've told us. So we have a lot of inconsistencies and is video.
Speaker1: Explains itself. It really, truly does.
Speaker1: You don't think that I have thought of?
Speaker1: Thought about the video or thought about, but no, again, if you don't mind, please. So you all are assuming that it's like, oh good, I got him in there, now I'm going to go to sleep. Is that what you are assuming? Well, it's not an assumption when that's what you told us. So that.
Speaker2: Happened.
Speaker1: And the video.
Speaker2: Yeah.
Speaker1: Yeah, I mean.
Speaker1: I'm not going to say.
Speaker1: You thought he could get out on his. Yeah, but the video shows that he cannot get out on his own. But I if but when I am such an issue with one finger.
Speaker2: From the outside.
Speaker1: But it had the hole in it.
Speaker1: And you're claiming that I had a paper clip, so that's what assisted you in doing it. No, what you told us when I had my sweatshirt, I said I thought it had a paper clip on it. It's got the zipper part is broken. That's. Yeah, which is why we were going to send it.
Speaker1: I I just.
Speaker2: You were able to unzip it from the outside very easily because that's the way they're designed.
Speaker1: But you could on the inside too.
Speaker1: I don't know how. Why wouldn't he have gotten himself out if he could? He wouldn't know. Like, I don't know if he saw like, where the whole was.
Speaker1: I don't know. No. I didn't see no.
Speaker2: Fingers.
Speaker1: On that, that's what I'm saying. Like he's in one position and where his head would be, we should be able to see fingers. And then when it's flipped over onto this right side again, his head is closer to us facing the video, so we should be able to see fingers and we don't see anything. We see no movement of him trying to unzip it or physically unzipping it. All we see is pushing up.
Speaker1: Trying to push out of it.
Speaker1: Please do not assume.
Speaker1: I'm assuming I haven't assumed anything. I follow evidence, but my intention was not. Again, ohh good, I got him in there. Now I'm just going to go to sleep. What do you think? Someone that knows nothing about this? Or here's just a little bit like oh, they were playing around in a suitcase and then and then watch you sleep.
Speaker1: That's what happened.
Speaker1: But you let him out before. I mean, you put him in. So why didn't you take him out? Because I was upstairs and I fell asleep.
Speaker1: No, before you upstairs, you like consciously had to walk upstairs. I mean, you obviously remember going to bed because you have to give me a time frame on that and you've specifically told me that that you have stairs.
Speaker1: My intention is not for this to happen.
Speaker1: I am sick about it.
Speaker1: I've never done anything like this before in the past. I am sick.
Speaker1: Especially with that, I thought I couldn't sleep last night.
Speaker1: I.
Speaker2: Don't know. Here's the thing.
Speaker2: You tell us the last night you you vividly remember this when you told us last night that he was laughing, you were laughing, you put him in the suitcase, he has two fingers sticking out, and you go to bed. Now we see something totally different, and it actually shows you upset. And again, using derogatory terms to him when he's begging for his life to get out of that suitcase. So we're assuming we're not assuming.
Speaker1: So.
Speaker1: It just happened to be that whenever I was videotaping or doing whatever else it was had just happened to not have that in it.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker2: And you also in the video you can't see any holes. There's no where in that where the zipper separation you could see a hole. If there's a hole he's pushing on it begging you to get out. We should probably see that that that hole is.
Speaker1: Probably would've been able to get out alcohol. Based on what you're telling us, he should have been able to get out. But the video.
Speaker1: Shows him attempting to get out, begging to get out, and he can't. So that's that's just what we're trying to figure out. I don't know if maybe you had too much to drink, you dipped it up all the way and then, you know, I did not tip it up all the way.
Speaker1: OK, well.
Speaker1: I did not zip it up all the way.
Speaker1: This is horrific. OK, horrific.
Speaker1: It is.
Speaker2: Terrible so.
Speaker1: Horrific.
Speaker1: I don't think I'll ever be right because of this, ever. Be right dealing with everything else that I have in my life personally, and then this, whom I loved.
Speaker1: It was not intentional.
Speaker1: I will put my hand on the Bible. It was not intentional.
Speaker1: I would not do that to him nor anyone else.
Speaker2: But you did.
Speaker1: Not intentional.
Speaker2: You intentionally went up to bed. I eventually left.
Speaker1: The bed, because I'm thinking.
Speaker2: OK. Yeah.
Speaker2: How did you not intentionally go to bed? You said you went up to upstairs and got into bed. That's intentionally going to bed.
Speaker1: Waiting for him.
Speaker2: And he doesn't come, but you don't go down to check on him.
Speaker1: So I happen to go to sleep when I say go to sleep.
Speaker2: And what you doing?
Speaker1: Whatever.
Speaker2: You do what do you normally do when you go to bed.
Speaker1: What do you mean?
Speaker2: What is about four?
Speaker2: Going to sleep, right? So you go to work you do.
Speaker1: What tells you that? Like I?
Speaker2: Tell you what, OK?
Speaker2: You kept telling us, hey, I wasn't intoxicated. I wasn't this. I wasn't that.
Speaker1: Being drunk and intoxicated which?
Speaker1: Yeah, she could tell I've been drinking, but.
Speaker2: OK, so if you weren't intoxicated.
Speaker2: Then why would you ever leave somebody in a suitcase that's begging to get out, that's telling you they can't?
Speaker1: Breathe. I weren't.
Speaker1: If I hadn't been drinking, you still think it would be the same thing where it's like, hop in, I'm gonna go to sleep.
Speaker1: Is that what you all are trying to do to portray?
Speaker2: And to do anything, I'm simply asking you to explain to me what happened.
Speaker1: Everything was fine and dandy.
Speaker2: Everything's fine and dandy.
Speaker1: What's fine and dandy you also OK for for me to tell you this again?
Speaker1: Mind you, I've been without him for a day now.
Speaker1: I don't.
Speaker1: No.
Speaker1: I I, I mean, I don't know what you all want me to tell you, because this was not in any way, shape or form. Hand on the Bible. Intentional.
Speaker2: OK, so you just.
Speaker1: I didn't kill him.
Speaker2: You left him there to teach him a lesson.
Speaker1: I didn't mean to leave him there. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Speaker2: You got up and walked away. How is that not intentionally leaving?
Speaker1: Them there because I'm looking at the whole knowing that it's so it's fair.
Speaker1: He'll get out and go home because you.
Speaker2: Don't. He doesn't, but you don't go check on him.
Speaker2: You say you're up for 30 minutes and he doesn't come up. You don't go down and check on him.
Speaker1: I'm in the bed. You even moved. You moved. You admit to moving the suitcase like over, so you roll it out like it's not like I said one of them maybe like that.
Speaker1: Don't you didn't want him to be upside down. How do you even get upside down, right?
Speaker2: Uh.
Speaker1: You guys are killing me right now.
Speaker1: I just want you to hear this.
Speaker1: That's how he talks to me. Mesh the time.
Speaker1: I don't know how, I don't know how.
Speaker1: You want me to say it?
Speaker2: I'm just trying to figure out what you would expect to happen to somebody when you leave them in a.
Speaker1: Suitcase. I didn't mean to leave him in there.
Speaker1: OK, what's your reasoning for not calling 911 sooner?
Speaker1: Because I didn't know what to do and how horrific it was.
Speaker1: I called Ryan and like, what, 5 minutes later I called you guys? Not even 5 minutes nonetheless that I had to like, try to. I was trying to do CPR.
Speaker1: I was trying to do CPR. I had to get him out.
Speaker1: And try to do CPR.
Speaker1: And then called you guys.
Speaker1: And they were continually doing CPR with the dispatch on the phone.
Speaker1: Where he had me count out loud to help me focus on what I was doing.
Speaker1: Edges.
Speaker1: I don't know how.
Speaker1: I mean you.
Speaker1: You can sit here all day long and say I thought he was going to get himself out, but that's.
Speaker1: He didn't. And you went upstairs and you stayed there for 30 minutes before you fell asleep. But can I say, if you like, chose not to ever, at any point during that 30 minutes, walk back down and check on him? No, wait one second. Because I know, like with you all, and then like, because you can't continually ask me like, timeframes, timeframes, timeframes where I told you like, I don't bother even looking at the clock most of the time. So it's like a guesstimate. So I, for all I know it was. Maybe it was.
Speaker1: 10 minutes.
Speaker2: But the point is, you left the living room where he was begging for help and went upstairs. Regardless of how long you were there, you left you.
Speaker1: Said. I thought he was about that boy calling Wolf.
Speaker1: Again.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker1: So when he asked to be let out, like what's your reasoning for not letting him out when I was upstairs? No, when he's asking on the video, he asked multiple times. He asked to be let out. I can't breathe. What? Like, why didn't you let him out?
Speaker1: Well, number one, I number one, I had no idea it was going to end like that. OK. Number one, OK.
Speaker1: #2 just you know what?
Speaker1: I'll give you 5 minutes or so, and then that's they'll give you 5 minutes or so.
Speaker2: 5 minutes for what?
Speaker1: Well, based off the video, one video is at 1112 and the next ones 1123. So you actually gave him at least 11 minutes per video recording. So my my thing is when it stopped he asked multiple times. I mean why why did you not let him out? It's just a simple question to be honest with you I mean.
Speaker2: Were you punishing them?
Speaker1: So.
Speaker2: Just well, that's what you're saying in the video.
Speaker1: This is what you got. This is what you make me feel like, see. And then it's all backfired on me. Like it's all backfired on me and I understand the severity of this. I.
Speaker2: Just don't use it.
Speaker1: It's awful, I know.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker1: It's awful.
Speaker1: And I will tell you both this right now too. I will never drink alcohol again. Like I will never drink alcohol again. I don't care what it is in any way, shape or form.
Speaker2: But let's get back to this. What was?
Speaker2: The reason for leaving him when he's begging to be let out, I don't understand that.
Speaker1: What I have a feeling was and again it's the whole time frame thing you go.
Speaker2: I'm not asking you time frame. I don't care about a time frame in the bag saying.
Speaker1: I I.
Speaker2: Did you say fuck you?
Speaker1: When he so like for like the whole few minutes that he was in there, like I.
Speaker1: Minimum 11, but yes, go ahead.
Speaker1: It's a few.
Speaker1: 11.
Speaker2: On one.
Speaker2: Video.
Speaker1: Well, in between those two videos.
Speaker2: Between 11 minutes, OK.
Speaker1: Yeah. So, So what was the question again?
Speaker2: When he's begging for his life, telling you he can't breathe, let me out and you say fuck you, why don't you just let him out? What, are you trying to talk to him?
Speaker2: There was obviously something in your head that you were thinking of when he was asking to let be let out. You're like.
Speaker1: Again, it's the boy calling Wolf.
Speaker2: OK, but where does where does this game end? I don't do you say this is a game you got?
Speaker1: Like the wrong way.
Speaker2: So what was your intention for leaving them in?
Speaker1: There. And it's not fair. It is not fair. You guys are trying to again, ohh, he's in there night. Night.
Speaker2: That's what happened.
Speaker1: Not.
Speaker2: Absolutely what?
Speaker1: Happened.
Speaker2: How's it not? You got up off the couch, walked up a flight of stairs and got in your bed?
Speaker1: Thinking he was going to.
Speaker2: Get out. And he didn't and you still didn't go down.
Speaker1: And it's the whole 30 minute thing that you guys are trying to do. Whatever like for all I know is it 10 minutes?
Speaker2: He's begging for his life, telling you he can't breathe.
Speaker1: I don't know what you want me to tell you like I don't.
Speaker1: I didn't intentionally mean for this to happen.
Speaker2: But you can't tell us.
Speaker1: Why?
Speaker1: You left him in there and went upstairs.
Speaker1: That's my only issue. Like what am I supposed to write? What do I write? So my thing is though, it's what I have a feeling is I went upstairs and just hit the bed kind of thing. But again, I'm thinking.
Speaker1: He'll be up here any minute.
Speaker1: But then I.
Speaker1: Go out. But my question is why don't you just let him out prior to going out? I don't know why.
Speaker2: He's begging to be let out. He's not laughing. He's not having fun.
Speaker2: I don't know. It's supposed to be fun. You were laughing before, before you said he was laughing, you were laughing. You went upstairs, he had his fingers out of the bag and he was playing. But obviously that's not the case.
Speaker1: So are you guys. So what is it you're trying to like? Like just trying to figure out why.
Speaker1: Why what? Why?
Speaker2: Why innovation for leaving them in the bag?
Speaker1: Why he was left in the bag, why I didn't have any motivation. It was me, he and I having a great day, fooling around, being stupid and apparently me going upstairs and going to hitting the bed, not going to sleep, or it's like I'm tired now. I'm going to go to.
Speaker2: Sleep that's excluding, you know, it's a good analogy for the day, excluding the fact that he's got a bump on the back of his head, a bump on the front of his head.
Speaker2: Lip is busted and he has a I, I.
Speaker1: Mean. I don't know what you all want me to tell you. Like this is not fair at all. At all that you all are assuming that that's from me.
Speaker2: We're also.
Speaker1: If you were, say it's opposite, you were in the suitcase and you're asking to be let out, would you hope that that person would let you out like you're asking to be let out of a suitcase? Should they not let you out?
Speaker1: Eventually, I'm guessing. I mean, I don't.
Speaker1: I'm blaming it on the wine.
Speaker2: Blaming it on the wine.
Speaker1: So you guys are like assuming that you keep saying we're assuming we're not, we haven't assumed anything, but you guys are assuming that that's what I did.
Speaker2: By what?
Speaker1: They did this.
Speaker2: The facts of what happened, we got there. You said you pulled them out of the suitcase. You said you went up, you went to bed. We're not assuming that these are the facts that you're telling us now. We're.
Speaker1: Tired. I'm tired. Well, that's what you told me on a sworn recorded statement yesterday because when I said, oh, you went upstairs and passed out, you were like, no, I did not pass out. You got attitude with me because you were assumed, you thought I was assuming that you were drunk. So that's that's an assumption. That was an assumption when I said you passed out.
Speaker1: And guess what? You corrected me.
Speaker2: You're very adamant about the fact that both of you had your weather. What's your favorite word to use?
Speaker1: Comprehensive.
Speaker2: You've used it today, too, to say that you guys are within your within your wedge, there's 22 empty bottles of wine.
Speaker1: Not about, but I think both of.
Speaker2: Them I think you did.
Speaker1: We did end. There's receipts for.
Speaker2: The saving both purchased yesterday, so I don't know how you didn't.
Speaker2: Because they weren't there the day before.
Speaker1: The one one.
Speaker2: Publix receipts from yesterday.
Speaker2: Only thing purchased on either one was a single bottle of wine. Two of them. So we have each bottle of wine that was empty in your garbage can that you purchased yesterday, or he purchased but you two would have consumed together.
Speaker1: OK, well, I mean there's receipts, so it's not even worth the.
Speaker1: So this is.
Speaker1: So I don't know what you guys are.
Speaker2: Shouldn't lay hands on each other, no.
Speaker1: I don't. I don't know. We were just hoping that we could figure out why you.
Speaker2: What was the motivation?
Speaker1: There was no motivation.
Speaker2: Wow. But we're watching a video that after talking to you everything was laughing and fun. Now we're watching a video where it's not laughing and fun. He's begging for his life and you are in a very angry voice telling him to fuck off.
Speaker1: No. Yes not.
Speaker2: That's absolutely what it was. It's not an assumption. The videos there, we played it for you.
Speaker1: So you guys think that I intentionally?
Speaker2: You didn't.
Speaker1: You.
Speaker2: And also on the couch I walked up the stairs and got into bed.
Speaker2: That was intentional. There's no way getting around that. You intentionally did that. Nobody dragged you up there. You didn't float up downstairs.
Speaker1: OK. Well, it's not fair. It's not fair that you guys keep trying to say that. That's what I did.
Speaker1: I don't know what to tell you.
Speaker2: You told us that you didn't go upstairs.
Speaker1: Again, there was a hole in a suitcase. I zipped it from the hole with one finger.
Speaker2: Well, the damn hole didn't do him no good, did it?
Speaker1: But he could push it open. No, he.
Speaker2: Wouldn't.
Speaker1: The video is him pushing up.
Speaker2: And.
Speaker1: If you could push it open, why wouldn't he have gotten out himself? Why would he beg you to open it?
Speaker2: OK, you he can't breathe.
Speaker1: OK, if someone can do something for themselves, they're going to do it. They don't need assistance unless they need assistance.
Speaker1: And start doing it because he couldn't because it was all the way zipped OK, see, it wasn't.
Speaker1: I intentionally didn't do it that I intentionally did not do.
Speaker2: You intentionally do what?
Speaker1: Zip it all the way.
Speaker1: He nor I, nor I. Well, he's dead as a result. On each other, he's dead as a result. I understand that. That's why they.
Speaker1: No.
Speaker1: I don't have anything.
Speaker2: Right.
Speaker1: He doesn't. Whatever that is, whatever this, whatever it.
Speaker2: Is.
Speaker1: See, this is what happens. It's not fair that you guys, just because he has those, automatically blame it on me like.
Speaker2: Well, what?
Speaker1: About when you had you, if your injuries and he gets arrested, is that not fair? Really, like really exact same thing really. He has injuries, you have injuries. Like, what does that mean? I don't have any injuries, correct. Because he and I have not been at it with one another. So every time that you guys fight you, you both hit each other. So you should have probably gone to jail all those times that he wanted.
Speaker1: Domestic well, the one time I did.
Speaker1: But he completely, completely.
Speaker1: Trashed the police report because that's nothing what happened, because the reason why I got taken was because my story was different than his.
Speaker1: So I'm being portrayed as like this abuser.
Speaker1: We're not saying that he doesn't abuse you.
Speaker2: Absolutely.
Speaker1: We're not saying so. I'm the one that's being portrayed as fear.
Speaker1: Because I have never dealt with anything like this before, I don't know what to do, how to do it, and I always know what to do and how to do it.
Speaker1: This I don't know, so I don't know like what's going on or like.
Speaker2: We are simply trying to find out as well. Again, we got one side of the story you're telling us. We're going with what you're saying, but then we find stuff that negates what you're telling us.
Speaker1: And I don't even remember doing that.
Speaker2: You're telling us that we're assuming stuff, but what we're simply doing is telling you what we saw in the video and eating what you told.
Speaker1: Us, I understand because I don't remember that.
Speaker2: OK, doesn't mean it didn't happen just because you don't remember it.
Speaker1: So is the texting thing something about me? Like what's?
Speaker1: Is the one.
Speaker1: Texting. Ohh no, I'm texting.
Speaker2: So I.
Speaker1: You guys are scaring me. So like, I don't know like what to expect. I mean, I had questions of things that need to be taken care of. Like I don't. What are your questions?
Speaker2: I have one last question. I just, I mean.
Speaker2: Realize you're the person that killed him, right?
Speaker1: I've thought about that.
Speaker2: OK, you left them in the bag when he's begging. You're saying I can't breathe? Let me out and you said fuck you.
Speaker2: And you got up off the couch and went upstairs and left him in that back.
Speaker1: Not hard and controlling.
Speaker1: I would never do that to George.
Speaker2: You did.
Speaker1: Not intentionally.
Speaker2: Know that I don't know that.
Speaker2: You got up and you went up to bed.
Speaker1: Alcohol is a shitty thing.
Speaker1: If alcohol.
Speaker1: Not again, the reason that you.
Speaker1: You all.
Speaker2: Please sit down.
Speaker1: Listen to me, you all listen.
Speaker1: I did not.
Speaker1: Not intentionally kill him.
Speaker2: So your intention?
Speaker1: I don't know what it is I need to do or how to do it or what to say or how to say it.
Speaker2: But you're but what was your intention?
Speaker1: Everyone knows. Everyone knows everything that I've done for George and loved him and continuously helped him throughout his life with me.
Speaker1: And made him a happier, better person.
Speaker2: And everybody has.
Speaker1: Everyone knows that.
Speaker2: Everybody has their limits.
Speaker1: So it's like, OK, so while we're in a good place right now, I'm gonna snap.
Speaker1: Is that what, while we're in a good world right now? Yeah.
Speaker2: Absolutely. I got you on video screaming. Fuck you.
Speaker2: Cannot.
Speaker1: This is what it feels like when you're choking me. This is what it feels like, which was, however, long ago.
Speaker1: You say.
Speaker2: Videos was from last.
Speaker1: Night. Clearly.
Speaker2: So wasn't that yeah?
Speaker1: They're still feeling further.
Speaker1: You wouldn't say it if you didn't feel it.
Speaker1: But I would never do that. But it happened. And you did. But that's after being playful. But no one's having a good day. No one's laughing except you every day. Ohh, I'm trying.
Speaker2: I would hate to see a bad day.
Speaker1: Y'all are making me out to be.
Speaker1: Person that I'm not.
Speaker1: Nor have or will I ever be, or are you a different person when you're drunk?
Speaker2: People have different personalities after they consume.
Speaker1: Alcohol. It depends.
Speaker1: It's like it's because you're sober now. So sober you.
Speaker2: What about drinking?
Speaker1: Not.
Speaker1: It's both of us.
Speaker1: It's both of us. And it's again, it's not fair that you all are assuming that the marks that he has on him are from me.
Speaker2: We asked you where they came from.
Speaker1: I have no idea.
Speaker2: What? Nobody else was there, so nobody else.
Speaker1: Was. I have no idea.
Speaker1: I swear I did not lay a hand on him.
Speaker2: You just zip them in the back.
Speaker1: Nor he.
Speaker2: Just zip them in the back.
Speaker2: And then you flip the bag around several times.
Speaker1: I didn't do that intentionally.
Speaker2: You didn't intentionally flip the.
Speaker1: Background, no. Why would I do that?
Speaker2: Well, you did.
Speaker1: When he was upside down, right?
Speaker2: But you had to put him.
Speaker1: You can't get in a suitcase upside down because the.
Speaker1: Oh my God, you put the body. Fortunately, nobody else was there.
Speaker2: The video showing the the suitcase in several different positions.
Speaker2: So it shows one like she just said it had to been on its back with the lid open for him to get in there for you to zip it up. Then it shows it on the other side with him in it, so you had to flip it to there. Then there's another video where it's on its back again, so you had to.
Speaker1: Fix it like this please. I'm leaving it like this. I did not intentionally do this.
Speaker1: No malicious content or effort was towards this. No malicious.
Speaker2: I would say this. Does that help you?
Speaker1: Sleep, but you're not sleeping, so.
Speaker2: The.
Speaker1: Last night I maybe got an hour right.
Speaker2: In your voice you can hear the maliciousness. The fuck you is very, very.
Speaker1: Talk to people like that. That's not like a common like, hey Scott Buck you. That's not, that's not common. It's not something people do and no one that sees that is going to think that, OK, so we were trying to give you an opportunity and and it is what it is. There's no maliciousness towards that.
Speaker1: I would probably be telling myself that my intent, my intent was not for that to happen.
Speaker1: But you went upstairs and went to bed.
Speaker1: Or maybe you passed out, I don't know, waiting for him and the whole time frame thing, it's like it's regardless. It's not really fair. Regardless. Waiting for him. He's not like you. You walked up the stairs. No one can. You can't fly up the stairs. No one can take you up there. Stairs, OK? You go up the stairs, you lay in the bed.
Speaker1: And you wait for him. Who cares if it's 5 minutes? Who cares if it's 30 freaking seconds? He's begging for his life. He's begging to get out.
Speaker1: You go upstairs.
Speaker2: You leave.
Speaker1: It doesn't matter. So it could it get the time frame out of your mind. It's this like it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
Speaker2: Because.
Speaker1: There's this.
Speaker1: So it doesn't matter anything what it is, I say. So it makes no difference whatsoever. It's just you keep you're lying and like you're not, you're now changing your story about what you're now, now now you're drunk. Ohhh. I never said that I was drunk exactly, but you did hear today.
Speaker1: That's OK.
Speaker2: You said earlier.
Speaker1: Everything's everything.
Speaker2: Required. You blamed it on the alcohol.
Speaker1: You blamed it on the alcohol. Alcohol does a lot to people, yes, but I never said I was drunk. You did.
Speaker2: So you did this. You did this sober.
Speaker2: You knowingly left them down there sober.
Speaker1: I have already told both of you also, that we were both drinking, right? OK, but you want to admit that you were drunk, is that I'm telling you all both.
Speaker1: This has changed my life.
Speaker1: I will take this.
Speaker1: At.
Speaker1: I don't know.
Speaker1: That's a true statement.
Speaker2: Absolutely.
Speaker2: But you're trying to dance around the fact that.
Speaker1: You just.
Speaker2: You left them in there. You're trying to dance around the box you left them in.
Speaker1: There, this is not you didn't leave him. Not it's not cool. Like this is not cool.
Speaker2: Not cool that he's.
Speaker1: Dead. But you think that I did that intentionally.
Speaker1: You think that I did that intentionally?
Speaker2: You intentionally left him in there and left the room. You went upstairs to a different room.
Speaker1: You intentionally.
Speaker2: Did that you? You did, yes.
Speaker1: Because I'm thinking it's gonna get out, OK? And he didn't. Obviously not.
Speaker2: But somebody's begging for their begging saying.
Speaker1: When you say that though, but you have.
Speaker2: To let me out, I can't.
Speaker1: Tell don't know George though, like.
Speaker1: Again, I thought it was a boy crying wolf. So it's just like what? Ohh. So if your son was in there and said I can't breathe, are you going to open it or is is he 9 so he's not you know really it's not a big deal question.
Speaker2: Oh, you said you would never put your son in a suitcase, you would only put George in there.
Speaker1: So George got in a suitcase.
Speaker2: And you looked it up?
Speaker1: Not all the way, and not intentionally to leave him there.
Speaker2: But that's what happened.
Speaker2: But you keep going away.
Speaker1: From I don't know.
Speaker2: That that's exactly what happened you.
Speaker1: Still trying to have me admit that? Like, are you trying to have me admit that? Because I will never admit it, because it's not true.
Speaker1: It's not true.
Speaker2: I'm basically staying as a fact because that's what happens.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker2: You videotaped him asking to be let out. You go upstairs.
Speaker1: So what guys? So what? Like, just, I don't know what you want me to say other than it was not out of maliciousness or intentional.
Speaker1: I don't know what or how I can say it.
Speaker1: I love George.
Speaker1: Love him.
Speaker1: To this day, still.
Speaker1: Love him.
Speaker1: Love makes you do crazy. It doesn't do. It's not one of those things where it's like, oh gosh, you know what, I've done enough for you at this point. I never gave up on him.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker1: Why I'm here today, I'm still not giving up on him.
Speaker1: I would do anything for him. Well, you gave up checking up on him.
Speaker2: Ohh gosh.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker2: We're simply just trying to go through. I mean, again, you gave us a completely different story that you charged up to. This was such a a laughing.
Speaker1: Matter. And it was fun.
Speaker1: All day all.
Speaker2: Day video all day.
Speaker2: Anybody looking at this, I don't think anybody will look that video. George is having fun right now.
Speaker1: So why is it you all think that I I y'all don't know me? You don't know me? No.
Speaker1: Would do something like that, especially having a 9 year old son.
Speaker2: Like why like?
Speaker1: Why are you, why are you so, like, caught on what we think? Yeah, when? Because you should learn about what you've told us. It's because you guys are like, trying the things that the video shows that are opposite of what you told us and then what you've now. What does that say?
Speaker1: Well, you said but it was funny and you're the only one. We were playing before that, OK?
Speaker2: But then it stops. Yeah, and obviously stops being fun. Well, I because you're screaming at him, he's not gonna get.
Speaker1: Out at him.
Speaker2: Sounds like screaming to me.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker1: I don't know what you all want me to tell you.
Speaker1: In no way, shape or form was this intentional.
Speaker1: At all.
Speaker1: Ever.
Speaker1: OK. Are you still going to allow us to do your fingernails? Go for it. Go for it. OK, cool. Alright, I'm going to get that set up.
Speaker1: Do you need anymore water? No. But when you come back and I ask about this, yeah.
Speaker1: So I.
Speaker2: Just don't understand.
Speaker1: So it.
Speaker2: Was understand how your story changes so much.
Speaker1: So the fact that it's changing. Please help me explain understand.
Speaker2: You went on about how this was such a playful thing and you guys were laughing, and it probably was for a few minutes. But then it obviously changes. The whole demeanor of this whole situation completely changes. It's not the funny laughing matter. He's not laughing at all.
Speaker1: I didn't think he was being serious.
Speaker2: You absolutely sound serious and you're answering.
Speaker1: So like just.
Speaker2: You don't think your voice you sounded serious.
Speaker1: It's OK, I.
Speaker1: I don't know what you want me to tell you.
Speaker1: It was a great day. It didn't end well.
Speaker1: Right.
Speaker2: Obviously, I'm sorry, that's I mean.
Speaker1: I can't explain to you. I can't explain to you.
Speaker1: How horrific. It was OK to find him.
Speaker1: Horrific, because I don't remember taking those videos. How horrific.
Speaker1: I'm thinking he's in the bathroom. I'm thinking he's downstairs in the laptop.
Speaker1: I can't find him.
Speaker1: So what? So what's going to happen?
Speaker2: Right. Here's what gets me though, is you don't remember taking videos, you don't know where he is, you don't remember him being in the in the suitcase, and you're still telling me that you had your wits about you.
Speaker2: How does somebody have their lives about them? When?
Speaker1: See, that's the thing too. But you can clearly tell. You can clearly tell that I had been drinking some. You can clearly tell.
Speaker2: I had several people that came up to me in that apartment complex said that you were drunk on a daily basis.
Speaker1: Ohh my gosh.
Speaker2: Right.
Speaker1: Regularly, right?
Speaker1: Really. Right. Talk to the property manager. Talk to the property.
Speaker2: Manager OK.
Speaker1: Because it's not.
Speaker2: These are your neighbors. The one that live next to your property manager does not live next to you. They see you everyday. How?
Speaker1: Many. You have two neighbors.
Speaker2: You went to and asked to go.
Speaker2: You had two different neighbors that lived directly next to you have to use the restroom, and they told you no. In terms of your wife, you had to go across the way to somebody.
Speaker1: Else no OK, Cam and Eli, Eli or Kim is not a nice person. She's just automatically not nice. Even after me looks went over there and introduced herself. She's just not a nice.
Speaker2: Person. Then why would you think she would let you use a restroom?
Speaker1: Because Eli was in there.
Speaker1: You like, comes over and talks to us sometimes, which I think kisses Kim off because he comes over and talks to us. The two of them, they're like super standoffish all the time. My neighbors down the street, down the way their toilet was broken. They had stuff in the bathroom.
Speaker1: So then they're like go over there and try over there. I would let somebody go upstairs and use my my personal bathroom. That's what the downstairs one is for.
Speaker2: If it's somebody you like, would you ask somebody you knew?
Speaker1: They're in the process of doing all this stuff in the kitchen, and there's stuff in the bathroom, and the toy doesn't work, just walk across the way, no problem. And of course they let me in.
Speaker1: Them, and then they're together.
Speaker1: Their part their families.
Speaker1: And nonetheless, if you really want to know, and I hope it doesn't get them in trouble, but he is over here illegally, so he's trying to work on getting his green card.
Speaker2: What does that got to do with you using the restroom?
Speaker1: They didn't want to be involved.
Speaker2: No, no, no. Last thing last night because, you know, I mean we had several different.
Speaker1: People I still neighborhood.
Speaker2: Eli and him drunk on a regular.
Speaker1: Basis, Eli and Kim, Eli and Kim OK. Did you ask any next door?
Speaker2: Those are the ones next door that she asked you use the restroom and they said.
Speaker1: No, no, she said no. And like I said, she's not a nice person. What are your questions?
Speaker1: Just coming to do the fingernails.
Speaker2: You said that, we said.
Speaker1: And you don't have to allow us to do it, just so you know. So don't think that I don't have a problem, OK? So make sure.
Speaker1: So am I getting my phone back?
Speaker2: No, not today.
Speaker1: Um, what about Lucas's laptop?
Speaker2: No, not to them.
Speaker1: What does that mean?
Speaker2: We're still going through.
Speaker1: Everything that's fine.
Speaker2: You're the one just telling us there's videos that we need to see on it, so we need to do our due diligence that we go through everything.
Speaker1: Seeing that backfires on main out too, because now you all think that I had even more in quotes intent to do what I did then, which was not intentional.
Speaker1: What's that in that?
Speaker1: Is that correct?
Speaker2: She's asking about your tag in your hand.
Speaker1: No, but I'm asking if that's correct. No, I'm not gonna read anything that you're saying. I'm not that you're.
Speaker1: So he's probably an officer.
Speaker1: Do you all inform her or do I need to call her?
Speaker1: We don't need to, we don't have to inform her. So would like to call you can.
Speaker1: Are you saying he's still on probation?
Speaker1: No, but because of the nice lady that she is and all that she's done for him, I thought it. I didn't know how it was. Legally, we just have to tell his parents and we don't go telling we don't. I didn't even know who his probation officer was, so no, I wouldn't go. So the same thing for classes.
Speaker1: I need to do that too.
Speaker1: Um.
Speaker2: Classes.
Speaker1: Substance abuse class and has battered intervention.
Speaker1: You know, you asked so.
Speaker1: Other than this.
Speaker1: So initially, what was the cause of that? She is still pending because she wants to hold the body for an additional day to see if more of those bruises turn into something bigger.
Speaker1: And she's doing some other tests that she's got to do, so she's pending it for now.
Speaker1: So. And that couldn't have been of him being in the suitcase.
Speaker1: Or the other thing and I basically.
Speaker2: Get it? That's what she's determining.
Speaker2: So the ones on the head I I asked her could that have been from the suitcase? And she said she didn't think so.
Speaker1: I didn't touch him, nor did he touch me.
Speaker1: I'm living in a dad.
Speaker1: Um.
Speaker1: So I don't know if you all know how to do this because I so that's what I was gonna ask you were gonna ask you. So are you all updating his parents today or when you get final whatevers?
Speaker1: What does it matter? Why?
Speaker1: What we tell his parents? What do you mean? Because I.
Speaker1: We're going to have, we're going to talk to with them, OK, I have to, but it's gonna come down to me.
Speaker1: What do you mean? Like so it's being put on me. Who said that?
Speaker1: But I'm not. So what is it you would tell them?
Speaker1: We're going to give them an update just like we gave you an update on their autopsy.
Speaker1: OK, so it's whatever broom.
Speaker2: And here's the thing. We had to deliver news to them last night that their son was dead. There's not a whole lot of conversation that goes on after that.
Speaker2: It's not a very.
Speaker1: Easy. Was it yesterday or Sunday?
Speaker1: Sunday, today's Tuesday, right?
Speaker1: Did we not meet you yesterday?
Speaker1: We might need yesterday.
Speaker2: Yeah, I'm just asking.
Speaker1: Right.
Speaker1: Did we not meet yesterday?
Speaker2: Probably question.
Speaker1: Really.
Speaker1: Yes, on Monday.
Speaker1: Got it. Perfect.
Speaker1: So I don't know if I asked you guys or how I find this out other than talking to his parents which.
Speaker1: It's not gonna happen, you know. Probably a terrible idea.
Speaker1: What? How do you guys suggest me finding out about funeral?
Speaker1: That's not even something that's been probably talked about between the family. That's not something we ask we have no way of.
Speaker1: I don't know. That's why I'm asking so.
Speaker2: Be up to them to make their arrangements of what they want to do. Like she's just told you this quick. Just being told last night, I'll pretty much be willing to wager that they have not even considered what they're going to do.
Speaker1: They would be released, so I've been there with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.
Speaker1: Umm.
Speaker1: So I don't know if I have the right to or not, but like I was going to call his former employees whom he really cared for and let them know.
Speaker1: You can call whoever you want, I just don't want to do something that I'm not supposed to.
Speaker1: Umm.
Speaker1: How do I go about getting his?
Speaker1: Uh, wedding ring? Engagement ring?
Speaker1: And that the medical examiner's office, it'll come to us eventually and then?
Speaker2: It'll be released to to the next with Kim.
Speaker1: Yeah, OK, I bought it for him.
Speaker2: That is a civil issue. It was on his finger. It goes to them. They're the ones that are going to release that. We don't have any say in them.
Speaker1: So I won't get that back.
Speaker1: So for all of this, like how do I find out what's what? How many like what's been found?
Speaker2: What do you mean?
Speaker1: Pillow with stain swab of stain from pillow suitcase that will all be sent off to.
Speaker1: Failing Florida Department of Law Enforcement, they do their testing so and then like, whatever, white.
Speaker1: Can with blood and necktie with blood was from the suitcase.
Speaker1: Why would you guys? You'll see it in there, the baseball bat.
Speaker1: For Lucas.
Speaker1: And update and this is just his phone, my phone and the laptop.
Speaker1: Yeah, when anything can be released, we will release it, but we are very early in this investigation and.
Speaker1: No overnight process unfortunately so.
Speaker1: What's next?
Speaker2: They're going to come.
Speaker1: No, I'm talking about like in the long run like what do I need to like do I need to be doing something or like I can't tell you what to do and I mean like so like for.
Speaker1: Like I don't understand. Like I don't know if you guys are gonna like.
Speaker1: Because it makes it sound like to me like I'm being accused of something that was not intentional, I'm being accused of it and a handful of other things and I'm being accused of.
Speaker1: So I don't want to be at home with Lucas and you guys show up.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker1: So it's we're still investigating that we're.
Speaker1: I don't know what you want me to tell you.
Speaker1: So if they're going to be concrete, whatever it is, and then it's like, OK, this is what it is, kind of thing or like, because I've done the whole court thing.
Speaker1: I've done the whole attorney thing, I've done whatever. So if I'm not admitting anything about being intentional and I killed George.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker1: That's not the situation, but it's trying to depend on me.
Speaker1: OK, that was not my intent.
Speaker1: But it's trying to be pinned on me.
Speaker1: Exceeding and penning.
Speaker1: So however, or whatever it is I need to do in order for that to be proven, then I need to do so, which is why I'm trying to get my ducks in a row.
Speaker1: So that's why I'm asking what the next step is, other than me getting my nails swapped.
Speaker1: I mean, you want me to tell you?
Speaker1: How to not be accused of a crime? Is that what you're asking? Like, I don't know what you I'm trying to prepare myself for whatever may need to be done so I can, I guess, stick up for myself.
Speaker1: I mean, I think you're doing just fine.
Speaker1: You came, you talked. I just don't want you guys to again show up and Lucas is in the house.
Speaker1: Well, we did tell you yesterday that we don't want to do anything around your son, hence why you came to us. So I don't know why you think that's going to change that and or may not just show up back home.
Speaker1: I'm sorry, what that or what? Me just not show up back home?
Speaker1: That's what up.
Speaker1: He's so happy that I'm staying over at the house with Brian. Like, so happy.
Speaker1: And I'm not going back to the house, to my house for however long. I can stay over here because of whatever to blow over.
Speaker1: And again, if you don't mind me asking so for.
Speaker1: Whatever it is, you all are.
Speaker1: Claiming from the videos. Which yeah, it's.
Speaker1: Is that what you're going to tell them? Like his parents? It's like, Oh yeah, and by the way, she did.
Speaker2: Did what?
Speaker1: I mean, what would you tell him?
Speaker2: I don't think it really matters what we're going to tell the parents.
Speaker1: Ohh yeah it is a steal for the fire.
Speaker1: Well, we can't hide things and I don't know. I'm not saying we're going to go.
Speaker1: I'm not saying that we're gonna go and tell them every single thing we have.
Speaker1: But again, this is the Orange Sheriff's Office as public records, so eventually, like this, all will come out.
Speaker1: So.
Speaker1: Is that like I'm not? You're making it sound like we're going to tell them something, so then your life is in danger and.
Speaker1: I don't like that accusation.
Speaker1: So let's just nip that in the butt right now. Well, that's what's going to happen.
Speaker1: I cannot I.
Speaker1: Choose, but we can't even but. So typically there's no concrete.
Speaker1: Report yet? Even, right? So. So it's you want me to, like, tell you exactly what I'm gonna tell them. I don't know what I'm gonna tell them. Let's just leave it at that. Just like you don't know why you went upstairs. I don't know what I'm gonna tell them. So.
Speaker1: Can I do? Can I call you the way that I did last time?
Speaker1: Yeah, my phone isn't open, mind.
Speaker1: Maybe he should be here. I don't watch TV.
Speaker1: I get it, but I get it.
Speaker1: That looks really bad.
Speaker1: So that's what scares me. Like, what do I need to plan on? Like what do I need to plan on?
Speaker1: I promise you.
Speaker1: On my son's life.
Speaker1: It was not intentional.
Speaker1: I promise you.
Speaker1: On look at his life, it was not intentional.
Speaker1: I don't know you. I can't say I know anything about you. I don't know what is.
Speaker1: What would be a true statement? All but not. I mean, you're promising on your son's life. That's fine.
Speaker1: That's how much it means.
Speaker1: Partners.
Speaker1: That's how much it means.
Speaker1: I hope you take that to heart.
Speaker2: Please.
Speaker1: And it's documented that you said that. Yeah, I got it.
Speaker1: Do you have any idea when I can get my phone back?
Speaker2: Cortana.
Speaker1: What do you say?
Speaker2: I just said no telling. I mean it's our digital friends comment is.
Speaker2: Got a lot of cases on their plate, I mean.
Speaker1: Well, and that's not trying to clean my laptop. It's Lucas's laptop, but he plays. You'll see all the games that he has on there.
Speaker2: As soon as we can get that back to Lucas, we will. As soon as we can release your phone, we will. But doesn't. We have no way of being able to tell you because we don't have control over their caseload and how they they arrange what they do. So I don't know at this point. I think honestly with everything else that's going on, that should probably be at the bottom of your list of worries.
Speaker1: I'm trying to make legacy so he can have his laptop back.
Speaker1: Does Brian not have a laptop for him?
Speaker1: He has his laptop that he has to do for work.
Speaker1: But he doesn't want him using it or breaking or dropping.
Speaker1: It's not a big deal. There's nothing on the laptop anyway.
Speaker1: So you will keep me posted like updated.
Speaker2: Hmm.
Speaker1: That's my thing is I'm trying to figure out what I need to do in the meantime.
Speaker1: I don't know. I can't like, I don't know what to tell you though.
Speaker1: Like what am I what?
Speaker1: But you all have more information than I do where it says, yeah, you might want to, or yeah, you might want to.
Speaker1: Like we have more information on what?
Speaker2: We told you everything that we have. You know, everything that we know.
Speaker2: And most of what we got from you.
Speaker1: But that?
Speaker1: Like I was telling her like.
Speaker1: Yeah, that's bad like.
Speaker1: Which, I swore in my son's life, was unintentional.
Speaker1: So that's why I'm trying to figure out what I need to do for myself.
Speaker1: Going forward with this, nonetheless with his family.
Speaker1: And are you all just showing up?
Speaker1: With Lucas's mouth.
Speaker2: We've already both told you that we will be mindful of any situations.
Speaker1: So anyways, I guess around coming tomorrow.
Speaker1: Or do we have come back down here?
Speaker1: I'll start with you next time.
Speaker1: I have no idea what I'm going to call you next.
Speaker1: Isn't the report come out tomorrow?
Speaker2: Our report.
Speaker1: Back at you guys going to sue that I'm that kind of person.
Speaker1: I'm just saying a report is generated through US and the Sheriff's Office is a public entity. So if someone were to come across something, then not talking about his autopsy, she's waiting and doing more follow-up. But.
Speaker2: She's looking at him.
Speaker1: Yeah.
Speaker2: But she won't be finished with him because she's she's pending further stuff.
Speaker1: So after this what?
Speaker1: I'm done.
Speaker1: For now.
Speaker1: How long does this sub take to get back?
Speaker2: The results? You won't get back the swabs and stuff.
Speaker2: Will stay.
Speaker1: But I'll know about it.
Speaker2: Our dispatch center keeps.
Speaker2: Calling my phone, I keep having to have other people call them and see what they need.
Speaker1: I hope you all can really both truly understand that that was not my intent.
Speaker1: I miss him a lot.
Speaker2: I mean no, but my question has remained the same.
Speaker2: What do you expect to happen to somebody when you leave on their position?
Speaker1: Yes, but you have to understand too. I'm.
Speaker2: Just.
Speaker2: What would you expect to happen to somebody when you leave them in a?
Speaker1: Position. I have no idea because I've never done it before.
Speaker2: Why? Have you ever done it before?
Speaker1: Why would I?
Speaker2: Exactly.
Speaker1: Why are you before?
Speaker2: Why did you do it now?
Speaker1: I clearly have said why? Why?
Speaker1: No, you don't know why. You just know that it's not intentional. But you don't know why.
Speaker1: But that's OK.
Speaker1: Really, I'm not trying to force you to say something that you don't know.
Speaker2: Not assuming anything, we're going by the fact that happened.
Speaker1: Like you said, you don't know me.
Speaker1: What time is it please?
Speaker1: 446.
Speaker1: In itself for me to have to live with.
Speaker1: Getting him out and doing what I did is.
Speaker1: Punishment enough.
Speaker1: I think that's why I haven't slept.
Speaker1: Because that's all I see.
Speaker1: So that right there says something.
Speaker1: Not my intention.
Speaker1: Texture.
Speaker2: Alright.
Speaker1: Nonetheless, I have to live without him now.
Speaker1: Nonetheless.
Speaker1: Punishment itself.
Speaker2: Definitely a tragic situation.
Speaker1: Alright.
Speaker1: Edinburgh.
Speaker1: It's unfortunate that.
Speaker1: Stupid things like this happen.
Speaker2: Absolutely.
Speaker1: Nonetheless, I have to live it on now.
Speaker2: His daughters, too.
Speaker1: Are you trying to make it worse?
Speaker2: Sorry, what?
Speaker1: Are you trying to make it worse?
Speaker2: Like what? Worse.
Speaker1: How I feel.
Speaker1: I that was there yesterday, I think, she said. Your photos.
Speaker1: So I'm just going to take a swab and go around on one hand and then do the separate one for your other hand.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker1: Thank you.
Speaker1: OK, I'm done with all these.
Speaker1: OK, Sarah.
Speaker1: So.
Speaker1: You're not free to go.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker1: Do you promise everything you told us is the truth?
Speaker1: Or no.
Speaker1: Everything we've talked about today.
Speaker1: Yes. What do you mean? I? He asked to swear. Remember how I swear yesterday on the on the audio recording? I just forgot. So he raised his hand to remind me to tell you. OK, do you promise? I'm sure that everything we talked about today has been true and accurate to the best of your knowledge.
Speaker1: For which accurate to the best of your knowledge.
Speaker1: But that it wasn't intentional. Everything you said today, everything that's come out of your mouth, has been true and accurate to the best of your knowledge.
Speaker1: To the best of my knowledge, correct.
Speaker2: Yep.
Speaker1: Mine.
Speaker2: That's how you spell somebody.
Speaker2: To assure that everything that we talked about is.
Speaker1: True and accurate to the best of that person's knowledge.
Speaker2: Question.
Speaker1: To the best of my.
Speaker2: Knowledge to the best of your.
Speaker1: Knowledge. Everything that you've told us today is true and accurate to the best of your knowledge.
Speaker1: Yes, but it was not intentional.
Speaker1: OK.
Speaker2: Alright, do me a favor, stand up.
Speaker2: Did you turn off Facebook off, put your hands behind your back? Do you have anything in your pockets that I should know about?
Speaker1: Why is this happening?
Speaker2: Because George is dead.
Speaker1: Not intentionally. We understand. She still.
Speaker2: Does.
Speaker1: Well, someone needs to call Ryan, please. OK, OK. Not make the phone call.
Speaker2: You'll be able to make a phone call when we get you down to the jail.
Speaker1: So this was a trick.
Speaker2: Anyone here to ask you to explain a few things to us and?
Speaker1: You were right. You're right.
Speaker2: Your response to everything was.
Speaker2: Basically, I didn't do it.
Speaker1: Intentionally through.
Speaker2: That matter.
Speaker1: Still there.
Speaker2: All in favor? Have a seat.
Speaker1: Really guys?
Speaker1: So if I didn't show up.
Speaker1: Why is this happening?
Speaker1: Because before you all said I could leave, that I was done after this, after that.
Speaker2: We were done, yes, we were done, absolutely.
Speaker1: So now, so that's what it is.
Speaker2: We are done.
Speaker1: Right.
Speaker1: Not intentional.
Speaker1: So what am I supposed to do now?
Speaker2: Do you?
Speaker1: Want someone needs to call? Brian Lucas is waiting for mom to come home.
Speaker1: This was not my intention, I thought. I was waiting for you all to come and figure out what's what and how many.
Speaker2: That's what we're trying to do.
Speaker1: And I was going to be able to go home and see Lucas.
Speaker1: Now he's just not going to have me come home.
Speaker1: So there's nothing that I can do.
Speaker2: All right. No.
Speaker1: There's nothing that I can do in order to go home and see Lucas and prepare.
Speaker1: So I asked for The Big Bang.
Speaker2: You will be afforded the time in court, you'll be afforded an attorney, you'll be afforded a chance to talk to a judge, and all that stuff will be.
Speaker1: Worked out. But what's the time frame for that though?
Speaker2: I have no way of being able to tell you you should make first appearance probably tomorrow morning if not tonight, depending how things are busy, how quickly you get down there.
Speaker2: I don't work in.
Speaker1: This is going to happen and I need water. Like really bad please.
Speaker1: We'll check me down here.
Speaker1: I just got those.
Speaker2: OK.
Speaker2: They are not allowed in the jail.
Speaker1: So I can't even smoke cigarettes. I go.
Speaker1: What?
Speaker1: And what am I supposed to do with my car?
Speaker2: And where it is?
Speaker2: When you get down there, you'll have free phones you'll be able to call.
Speaker1: What as soon as possible?
Speaker2: Yeah, once you get down here, get booked, done, you'll be able to use the phone in the in the.
Speaker1: Waiting long will that take because I need to talk to Brian.
Speaker2: You know, depends how busy, how quickly they get you through, probably within the hour.
Speaker2: It's a free phone call in the lobby. It's a free phone.
Speaker2: She has no clue.
Speaker1: So can I ask you or whoever it is?
Speaker1: Umm.
Speaker1: Those holding cells, the holding cells. Am I gonna be paying one of those? I don't know. Last time I had a panic attack, let them know that. Yeah, I don't.
Speaker2: Know well you you're familiar with the Big Bay. As long as you go in and you act civil to them, they'll set you on the big bag and you'll be left there.
Speaker1: For a while.
Speaker2: We don't work at the jail.
Speaker1: As long as long as like he's saying if you don't.
Speaker2: Act like this. You'll go in and they'll put you in the Big Bay. If you go in there screaming and kicking and yelling and cursing at people, I don't know. I'm just letting you know. That's what happens. That's how they they weed people out if you go in acting like this.
Speaker2: Don't put you there as long as you're acting like this.
Speaker1: I yeah, because the last time I had a major panic attack on the little thing.
Speaker1: So what am I going to do with my purse?
Speaker1: It's gonna come, but the cigarettes and stuff can't, so.
Speaker2: I put the lock up to my left.
Speaker1: Ohh that's all good. Mine are now off so so.
Speaker1: What made you all decide to do this?
Speaker2: Made us decide to do.
Speaker1: This.
Speaker2: George is dead.
Speaker1: You guys, I knew this was gonna happen.
Speaker1: Well, you're willing.
Speaker2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker2: We were trying to figure out what's going on. We're still trying to figure.
Speaker1: Out intentionally.
Speaker2: Trusting or not, George is dead.
Speaker2: You act like when you say unintentionally. That absolves you from everything.
Speaker1: I need to get. I have my. I don't know if it's able to be or not.
Speaker1: I have things in my car that I need to put your.
Speaker2: What kind of stuff do you have in your car that you worried about?
Speaker1: Well, I have my medication.
Speaker2: OK. They have a pharmacy there. So if there's something that you have to have right away, you'll be seeing.
Speaker1: Another panic attack.
Speaker2: Again, when you get checked in, we're going to be seeing your.
Speaker1: Nurse.
Speaker2: Yeah, they have a pharmacy there, so they'll be able to take care of any kind of that stuff. That protocol is out of my realm. I don't work down there. So I don't know. But I do know that you do have a partnership and that you will be afforded to see somebody.
Speaker2: OK, hold on.
Speaker2: But.
Speaker1: Mother.
