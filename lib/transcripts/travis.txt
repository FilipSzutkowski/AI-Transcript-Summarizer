Interviewee: I get you.
Interviewee: You can take.
Interviewee: Can you take the?
Interviewee: Detective gets in here. Detective Flores. He can.
Officer: Take those off for you.
Interviewee: I think that's what he told you.
Officer: Anyway, he'd allow you to have your customers.
Officer: Right.
Officer: Here we go.
Officer: Let me get those off here.
Officer: Let me get you a bottle of water.
Interviewee: Any chance you could get them first? Yeah, we'll get.
Officer: That from the house.
Interviewee: Will they bring it to me?
Officer: Putting your property.
Officer: There's water for you.
Interviewee: Yeah, I'm ready to turn the heat up in here. Like you have a sweater like tomorrow or something. I don't know where the sweaters. I'll see. I'll see if I can turn it off. It's hard to control the heat in this building.
Officer: I'll lock myself in here.
Officer: So you Remember Me?
Interviewee: Of course I do.
Officer: I traveled all the way up here.
Interviewee: Can talk to you.
Officer: Because.
Officer: Yeah, I've been working on Travis's case ever since it happened. OK? And I know exactly.
Officer: When it happened? When he was killed.
Officer: I know a lot of details and just recently we.
Officer: Quite a bit of evidence.
Officer: And I'll discuss that with you.
Officer: The main thing that I'm looking for though, is answers.
Officer: On why certain things happened, why they went so far and also get your statements OK.
Officer: A lot of details on this case that haven't been released to to the public and not even the Travis family.
Officer: And those details.
Officer: Are known only by US and the person who did it.
Officer: OK. And and that's.
Officer: One of the reasons I'm here is because I believe that you know some of these details.
Officer: I think you can help us.
Interviewee: I would love to help you in any way that I can, OK?
Officer: Um.
Officer: Because we're here at the Police Department, the Sheriff's Department here in was at Sisku County. This was called.
Officer: And you're considered.
Officer: Under arrest or detained, you're not free to go. And I'm a police officer. I have to read you your rights, OK? I'm sure you've heard them on TV.
Officer: You know.
Officer: I have to read them off this little card here, but they're pretty much the same and I'll explain them to you as we go, OK?
Officer: Let's see.
Officer: This is July 15, 2008, correct?
Interviewee: Yes.
Officer: Let's see what time it is here.
Officer: It's 1001.
Officer: This is case number 2008 1610844.
Officer: You do have the right to remain silent.
Officer: OK, anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
Officer: You have the right to the presence of an attorney to assist you party questioning and to be with you during questioning if you so desire.
Officer: If you cannot afford an attorney, you have the right to have an attorney appointed for you prior to questioning. Do you understand these rights?
Officer: And what I'm going to do?
Officer: It's just ask you some questions, ask you what you've been doing.
Officer: You know, certain days what you were up to, yeah.
Officer: You mentioned you were traveling on some of these dates I traveled. I want to kind of clarify some of these things. And you know, if there's a question that you don't want to answer, you don't feel comfortable, you can say no. You know it, or, you know, you can elaborate as much as you want. If it's completely up to you, it's at your speed. I don't want to pressure you.
Interviewee: Should we?
Officer: No, I don't. I don't know if there's a recording or anything.
Interviewee: I don't know if these are voice recorders. I noticed them.
Interviewee: Batteries.
Officer: I don't think they're on.
Interviewee: Cycle.
Officer: Yeah, I haven't touched those or anything, but uh.
Officer: Um.
Officer: And they're not on so.
Officer: What I want to do is just get to the bottom of it. Everybody wants to know, OK and.
Officer: You know, so I'm going to ask you some questions. You can voluntarily answer them if you want. OK. Is that cool? Yeah.
Officer: There was some question about you being.
Officer: Well, let's let's start with this.
Officer: What have you been up to since?
Officer: Since Travis is dead.
Officer: What have you been doing?
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: Well, I've been working.
Interviewee: I haven't been really working in prepaid legal. There's not a whole lot.
Interviewee: Here in this marketplace which is.
Officer: Kind of small.
Interviewee: Here it's small here and really that that could be seen as an opportunity rather than a hindrance because that just means the market isn't is undoubt in a larger way. So I could have if I wanted to, but.
Interviewee: I have. I'm kind of like a deer in the headlights when it comes to prepaid label and I could I just have a fear of just approaching people.
Interviewee: So I've been working at a Mexican restaurant in the North End of town.
Interviewee: Umm.
Interviewee: I've been.
Interviewee: I've been kind of in a daze, at least for the first few weeks.
Officer: Like everybody you.
Interviewee: Know, yeah.
Interviewee: I know that a lot of people have been posting on Facebook really nice things.
Interviewee: You know, and memories. And at one point it was like, oh, maybe I should do that. So I posted this thing and I just said all my memories.
Interviewee: I realized looking back on it that it was kind of, it kind of sounded immature. It's more like my dear Travis kind of letter.
Interviewee: And so I took it down because.
Officer: Personal.
Interviewee: Yeah, some of it was.
Interviewee: Personal, not too personal, nothing inappropriate, just.
Interviewee: I just.
Interviewee: Felt funny. I think because I'm a photographer I tend to communicate more with the pictures. So I posted a ton of pictures that I had of him and I have a ton more that I just can't access right now.
Interviewee: And videos and things that I know his family would want, but.
Interviewee: So I posted pictures and I took that down and I posted something last week. But other than that I've been on Facebook and Myspace a lot. Looking at his profile, looking at his pictures, reading things about his obituaries.
Interviewee: Any news updates and you know there's Legacy.com where you can write something about him.
Interviewee: Um.
Officer: I've seen a lot of those postings.
Interviewee: I didn't realize until I actually spoke with Ryan Burns.
Interviewee: He he told the guy that's in Utah and we've been talking a lot. We try not to talk about that because it's kind of like and plus Travis is my ex-boyfriend but the same time he's my friend. So while I'm morning my friend, how do you talk to your new potential possible maybe person that you might start dating about your friend even though he was your ex-boyfriend. So it's kind of a Gray area. I try not to talk about it too much but he comes up a lot.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: And it was through him that I learned that, he said. You know, if you come out to Utah, things are really weird because everyone is. Everyone thinks that you could have had a hand.
Officer: And I've talked to a lot of people and.
Officer: Everybody's pointing the finger at you.
Interviewee: I know.
Officer: You know, everybody is saying I don't understand what happened to Travis. I don't know who killed him.
Officer: Like you need to look at Jody.
Officer: And sometimes the simplest.
Officer: Answers.
Officer: Are the correct ones.
Officer: And that's one of the reasons I started looking at you a little bit closer.
Officer: And over the last month or so, I.
Officer: Gotten into Travis's life.
Officer: Talk to all his friends, his family.
Officer: I got a really good understanding of who he is now.
Officer: And.
Officer: I got a very good understanding of your relationship with him.
Officer: And.
Interviewee: In.
Officer: I'm kind of just putting two and two together.
Officer: Well, and and it's and it kind of matches.
Officer: So one of the reasons I'm here is to talk to you and figure out.
Officer: What was going on between you two? What I know the relationship that you guys had was of convenience sometimes.
Officer: Obviously you weren't boyfriend girlfriend anymore, but you were still.
Officer: Having a sexual relationship.
Officer: Which?
Interviewee: Just, you know, family know about this.
Interviewee: Just curious.
Officer: No, his family doesn't know anything.
Interviewee: Yeah, I just, I'm. I'm interested in protecting his and how he's remembered as well and.
Interviewee: You know, he's he was very he was.
Officer: Well, I'm sure if Travis could speak right now, he wouldn't care what people thought about him.
Officer: Because they knew who he was, OK? A sexual relationship here or there.
Officer: Because the fact he was a member of the church really doesn't matter.
Interviewee: In the end times I have.
Officer: Whole range of.
Interviewee: Things. Yeah, I think in the broad scope of things that that could be right. I just think that the reason I care about that is because he was adamant about that. A couple of times we prayed about it didn't work or we didn't stick to our, you know, our guns on it. And one time a girlfriend of mine just said why don't you just go to your Bishop and talk and and astragalus the same. And I talked to him and he got really angry. He said I've already had problems with this in the past.
Interviewee: Embarrassed by it, I don't want to go to my Bishop.
Interviewee: And so we just kind of stopped for like a few weeks and then that must have been, I think it was August and then it just resumed.
Officer: Well, the way Travis stopped by, you know, getting into his head and everything that he's written in his journals and.
Officer: From everything I found out about it.
Officer: He he truly had feelings for you.
Officer: And for some reason.
Officer: He felt that the relationship between you and him was somewhat unhealthy, but he couldn't stop it.
Officer: And I assume it's probably maybe the same way you felt about him or?
Interviewee: It's.
Interviewee: Well.
Officer: Maybe you didn't understand why he didn't believe it was healthy.
Interviewee: No, I I didn't think it was healthy either. Spiritually at least, and probably emotionally, but mostly spiritually. And I think that kind of once you have something that's not healthy spiritually, it filters through all aspects of your life. It's.
Interviewee: It's one of the main, it's one. But there were three main reasons I moved back to America, and one was I was in financial dire straits.
Interviewee: I was not getting ahead. It was not.
Interviewee: I just things were not working. Everything in Arizona was like except for the wonderful friends that I made in my ward.
Interviewee: And the opportunity, it's like the Mormon land of opportunity there, which is awesome. But except for all that, like, every sign was pointing. Just just go, you know? You know, I wasn't able to hold a job, and that had never happened before.
Interviewee: It you know it too much of my.
Interviewee: My night life can was was about him you know he would text me and hey I'm getting sleepy... the benches ease and that was his.
Interviewee: Code to like come on over kind of thing. That's it. Cost is clear, you know.
Interviewee: So, um, you know, and that was just, I lived 5 minutes away, 10, maybe 10.
Interviewee: Depending. And it was just too convenient and too easy. And it was fun and we had fun. We were together and so it wasn't healthy. And I totally agree with that. So that was one of the reasons. Well, financially I wasn't doing well. I missed my family. I moved away shortly after high school and I come back to visit. But I realized over the years I've missed out on a lot of things with my little brother and sister. Missed out on just.
Interviewee: They're karate or they're baseball or cheerleading or.
Interviewee: Whatever. And um and my dad is not doing well.
Interviewee: He doesn't think he has very long to live, and he always says that it's been that way for like a decade. He's still here, thank goodness.
Interviewee: My grandparents aren't getting any younger and I just have an awesome family.
Interviewee: And I wanted to be able to just.
Interviewee: Be here for a little bit and regroup financially.
Interviewee: I owe my parents a lot of money and I have my grandparents a lot of money, and I owe friends money I owe.
Interviewee: I know I am.
Interviewee: The guy that I bought a house with, I owe him a lot of money. He doesn't ask me for it, but I intend to pay him back because he really footed the bill on the mortgage for a few months.
Interviewee: And the third reason, and I like to put this third because I like to think that second of those reasons I would have been strong enough somehow. But the third reason was to put a distance of physical distance between Travis and I because.
Interviewee: I know that he really liked me, and he said he did.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: He just.
Interviewee: I kind of felt guilty. I mean, I know they weren't dating, but I just felt guilty somehow. And I didn't know Ryan at the time.
Interviewee: I met him in in March at in Oklahoma City, and it was just brave. And I remember seeing him and saying, oh, I really want to go say hi to him, but he was surrounded by people and he was he was kind of unapproachable.
Interviewee: He says he remembers meeting me too, and it wasn't until Zion and my friend.
Interviewee: Texted me and you know, I think I told you that.
Officer: And this is all after.
Interviewee: This is all broke.
Officer: Out. Oh, you broke up a trial is everything's all.
Interviewee: Over. I'm. Yeah. As far as the timeline we broke I well, it was kind of a mutual thing but I sort of more broke up with him.
Interviewee: Um, and I it was hard to do because it really loved him. But I just realized that without trust you can't have anything. And I had violated.
Officer: His trust is that the main reason you guys broke up is the trust, the trust.
Interviewee: I think that.
Officer: There's not that the relationship was unhealthy because of the sexual activity security, but just that you guys couldn't trust each other.
Interviewee: Doesn't make it right. I think that, you know, being a convert, you know, I've had, I I've been, I've had a couple of serious relationships before where I was, where I was intimate.
Officer: With a few people.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: It's kind of silly but I used to always joke that, um, regardless of what the Bible says, and yes I'm Christian, I just live my life by the 10 Commandments. And that's my those are my roles that... dot, you know they'll shall not this or that but it doesn't say thou shalt. So I I just used to joke about that and that's it's a bad philosophy. I think that with Travis.
Interviewee: Um, there was part. There was a part of me that felt really guilty because there was something inside that thought you're you're, you know, this is nice for instant gratification, but you're destroying what you could have.
Interviewee: With Travis. And that's why we we did pray about it. I remember we knelt by his bed once and um.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: Surprisingly, he suggested it. Normally, you know, we would. I would suggest that we pray before we go on a trip or before we eat if we're.
Officer: Alone, it was kind of unusual for him.
Interviewee: Yeah, because he was very resistant to prayer with me. I mean, I think in church would be fine and I feel that maybe because.
Interviewee: We were driving away the spirit constantly.
Interviewee: Or maybe he felt that by inviting the spirit, but he would feel guilty about later on in the evening. Or I don't know what the deal was or the excuse he used was because I'm a convert, I need more practice thing prayers. He's like. So I'd say, well you say fair, he's like, why don't you say a prayer?
Interviewee: Why don't you say it for a while? You say it first, so we go back and forth and.
Interviewee: I don't know and so I don't know. It's just.
Interviewee: One time when I was on a trip with let's have at Havasupai, we were all getting on the road and.
Interviewee: I think Dan, it was with Dan Freeman and his sister Desiree and they were all like Jody, would you say a prayer? And I said sure and and Travis is like.
Interviewee: Anyway, I didn't want to argue with them so.
Interviewee: Anyway, what was I saying?
Officer: Well, he's um.
Officer: You know, the whole trust issue keeps coming back into my mind.
Interviewee: That was the big reason.
Officer: He was a he was a big time flirt and that's the one thing everybody says about him. He flirts a lot.
Officer: Doesn't mean anything by it.
Officer: Not really. That's just who he is.
Officer: Um, he did have, you know, girlfriends here there. And he was at a point in his life where he wanted to really start settling down.
Officer: He felt like.
Officer: He needed to kind of grow up.
Officer: You know, become my husband, become a father, you know, those that time had come and he felt that.
Officer: The time had come and gone, and he was falling behind.
Interviewee: He told me that too. He said he felt like his time was running out and I told him.
Interviewee: That, you know, despite the fact that he's not going to be in the singles ward merch longer, he still has a lot of options. He's still a very eligible bachelor.
Interviewee: And he he just didn't see it that way. He's like, you understand, he's like, that might be true, but my chances are severely reduced once I turn 31. It was like this ticking.
Officer: Time finding that a good Mormon girl, you know, was.
Officer: It was difficult because in that church you know that.
Officer: Lots of girls get married early 20s. Yeah, you know.
Interviewee: He said he didn't want to marry a girl in her early 20s because.
Interviewee: He said that he noticed a lot of pattern that church with girls that married between 19 and 24 so that they could.
Interviewee: Would you know, they'd start having babies and growing their family and then they would look at their single girlfriends who are still having fun with their responsibilities and they would regret getting married. And I think if you're strong in the church that's not so much a problem, but.
Interviewee: Well.
Officer: Depends on who you surround yourself with.
Officer: Be surround yourself with the right people, you know.
Officer: It's a different story.
Officer: But you know, that's where he was. And did you guys ever discuss possibly getting married or anything?
Interviewee: When we were dating, we did OK once we broke up.
Interviewee: He brought it up. He actually proposed to me.
Interviewee: A lot of times that he wasn't serious.
Interviewee: Um, and he was. He was serious once. And it was when we broke up.
Interviewee: And that was really hard because we were on the phone and it was just like, none of that stuff should be done on the phone anyway, but I was hundreds of miles away.
Interviewee: And I told him that I loved him. We didn't say I love you during our relationship, but we said it afterward. It was weird. It's woke up, I said. You know?
Interviewee: This isn't it's. Breaking up with him on the phone wasn't really the way I wanted to do it.
Interviewee: But it was kind of a situation that had just come to us.
Interviewee: To the point where I just couldn't be ignored anymore and.
Officer: Was moved to after the breakup.
Interviewee: Oh, OK.
Officer: One time.
Officer: What kept you in Mesa at that point?
Interviewee: I actually moved to Mesa a few weeks after we broke up.
Officer: Really.
Interviewee: I mean, as far as the timeline goes, but I mean if you want to call it our official breakup shortly thereafter, it's like we were still seeing.
Officer: Each and you guys were seeing each other, but.
Officer: It was a long distance type relationship.
Interviewee: It was always long distance. When we were officially dating, we didn't. We had dated. We dated from about the beginning of February to about the end of June.
Interviewee: So February, March, April, May, June, about five months total.
Officer: In June 2007, you guys broke up and.
Officer: And then you moved to Mesa?
Interviewee: Um, yeah, I moved to Mesa. Sort of.
Officer: Most people, when they break up, they kind of go.
Interviewee: I know where it was and we plans were already in order for me to move there and I was already speaking with a friend who was.
Interviewee: You know.
Interviewee: Was going to be her roommate, and I was her roommate for a short time.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: She's kind of flighty. She's a great girl though.
Interviewee: I had talked to Travis about maybe going to Southern California instead.
Interviewee: And he's really.
Interviewee: He's he's really.
Interviewee: Persuasive.
Officer: They persuade you to stay there, Mesa.
Interviewee: He's he kind of was playing up all the advantages if I did come to Mesa.
Interviewee: And if I did, you know.
Interviewee: He said. You know, it's it's a great place. We could still see each other and hang out on occasion.
Interviewee: It's church is very strong. You know, you'll you'll make a lot of friends.
Interviewee: And I already knew all this stuff prior, because I hadn't. We talked about that.
Interviewee: You know, and so I went ahead and just made the move. It sounded at the time like a good idea.
Officer: And you guys continue to kind of see each other at that?
Interviewee: Time, yeah. At the time was sort of living more across town over by Greenfield. Do you know where that is? Yeah, it was at Greenfield near Broadway, Greenville, Broadway, where the nearest cross streets and that's where the girl that I was originally talking with, I moved in with her.
Officer: That's kind of far from.
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah. The thing about her and and just to give you a background of why I moved suddenly she.
Interviewee: Approached me the weekend after I got there and said hey, she knocked on my door. Can I talk to you for a second? I said sure, and she moved in with her boyfriend and they were engaged.
Interviewee: OK. And she said, hey, I just wanted to let you know that Scott and I went to Vegas last week and tied the knot. And I was like, really? She's like, yeah, we haven't told anyone, but we didn't want to live in sin, so we're going. And she had already been sealed in the temple once and was waiting for her cancer.
Interviewee: Are you taking her?
Interviewee: Yeah, to be careful. So they were going to have a civil wedding.
Interviewee: With Rachel over on Greenfield number.
Interviewee: Before when that started.
Interviewee: He just holds.
Interviewee: On the beach in Oregon. And they did that the following the following weekend. She told me that on a Monday or Tuesday, it was the beginning of the week. And she said the reason I'm telling you that is because I'm getting married this weekend and I have to go out of town a few days ahead of Scott, you know, make arrangements. And now that he's a married man, we don't feel it's right that you'll be here in the house. Yeah, just, I don't want to inconvenience you, but is there any way you could stay with somebody else or just find another place? The time I was waiting on a house in Gilbert because I already knew they were getting married. So I was kind of looking anyway. And there was a great girl.
Interviewee: Brenda and she was waiting on her keys for the mortgage to go through and it was a great ward, it was a great house and it was brand new.
Interviewee: Construction and all that. It was really nice. But she didn't get her keys for months and months. I think she's in the house now, but I don't know. I haven't talked to her.
Interviewee: And so I scrambled. I went to the institute. I wrote down a bunch of phone numbers. I called them all, lot of them. I got voicemails. One girl that answered her name is Tiffany, and she knew Travis and she was at his services in Arizona and.
Interviewee: As well. And we've just remained friends, sort of like on Myspace and Facebook and that kind of thing. But she said, hey, sorry, that's not dated posting, I forgot to take it down. Go to this website, soeliashousing.net. I went there. I made three phone calls for the places that were within my price range. I didn't think to look where they were. The one girl that called me back, her name is Shannon Derricott. She said here's my place, here's the directions. Go ahead and go out and come see. The house was available, so we did.
Officer: Oh, go ahead. You have to get that, OK.
Interviewee: Um, so I moved out there and when Travis found out it was so close to him, he freaked out about it.
Interviewee: And I made sure to check that it wasn't that, that we wouldn't be in the same ward and it was within his ward boundaries, but it was also within another singles ward boundary. So of course I'm gonna go the other one because it would just be kind of weird, I mean.
Interviewee: I didn't know about him and Lisa.
Interviewee: At first, uh. So I I don't know if they were even dating at that time. I don't know if their whole timeline was.
Interviewee: But it still would have been weird and it wouldn't have made.
Officer: During that time that he was seeing Lisa, did you continue to to see him as well?
Interviewee: Yeah, and I didn't know that he was seeing her, OK?
Officer: But he would call you, and have you come?
Interviewee: Over.
Officer: Yeah, I know there was a time when you. I guess we're cleaning his house too for for extra money or something.
Interviewee: Yeah, yeah, I did that now because he knew that I was struggling and he he's like I've been doing the math and that happened pretty much right on. I think it was started that started in August. He's like I've done the math and I feel that.
Interviewee: Can be more protective.
Interviewee: My time is more valuable than X amount of dollars per hour. So why don't I pay you this per hour and I'll work and you can make a little bit of money.
Officer: So that that makes sense. That was around the same time time frame was the move and back it was.
Interviewee: Like a few weeks after the move, I was still living in.
Interviewee: And he sent me this picture and he's like, this is your uniform habit by Friday or Thursday or whatever. And it was this French painting, and I was like.
Officer: No, you know, it's him. Typical.
Interviewee: Yeah.
Officer: I think I said he's he's a very flirty guy and.
Interviewee: He is.
Officer: Now obviously the Rachel really or.
Officer: At least the relationship didn't workout.
Officer: And then it was time period. He really wasn't seeing anybody. And then Mimi came into the picture.
Officer: What did you think about?
Interviewee: Her. I didn't know a lot about her. She seems like a really nice girl. He showed me her picture on Facebook, you know, I don't think she had a lot of pictures on there.
Interviewee: He said that he's not sure why, but he's pretty sure that she could be it.
Interviewee: And I was happy for him. Um, I didn't find out about.
Officer: Least conversation you had face to face with.
Interviewee: Him. Yeah, yeah. It was in his room.
Interviewee: And he had his laptop, you know, just on his set.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: I didn't find out, at least until after we wrote. We had this conversation where we decided all just come clean.
Interviewee: And that was quite a conversation.
Interviewee: Um, because I was never unfaithful, but there, you know, when we started dating that timeline around February?
Interviewee: The reason I remember February is because he had told me in December, you know, go date, other people kind of thing.
Interviewee: And so I did. Um, it was January 10th that I went on a date with.
Interviewee: My friend Officer.
Interviewee: For lunch, we just don't have sushi. Nothing romantic happened. We hold hands, we didn't kiss. We we think we have it. And I guess it was considered today because he asked me and I accepted and paid for it. And that was in Pasadena.
Officer: If he pays for it.
Interviewee: Yeah.
Interviewee: That was in Pasadena. And the following evening I went out with my friend Abe and we he drinks. He just got like a makers mark, I think it was his drink. And I got cranberry juice and we just talked forever about, he talked about politics.
Officer: Which is these guys in Marine Corps or?
Officer: Girls.
Interviewee: Something they're both in prepaid legal. Officer Dixon is not in prepaid legal anymore. He's moved on to other ventures.
Officer: No, but the the Marine Corps, are they in service at all? Yeah.
Interviewee: OK, Abe is kind of, he's a little bit older. He's just sort of businessman.
Interviewee: Has a background in I don't remember.
Officer: Production and this is during the time that you guys were broken up or this is kind of going?
Interviewee: I'm sorry, this is before we started dating. OK, the reason I say this is because he told me a few times, he told me during that conversation too, that he's like, you seem to have a very convenient timeline for when we started dating because I used to ask him like, when did we actually start dating?
Interviewee: Because I figured if we ever made it to a year, we might as well celebrate. Um. And he's like, I'm not really sure. And the reason? I think it was February 2nd.
Interviewee: Is because we.
Interviewee: Do you know if Chris and Sky Hughes OK? Um, I used to spend a lot of time at their house.
Interviewee: And um, you know.
Interviewee: They're wonderful family and she's guy was she. She's somebody that I really opened up to and you.
Interviewee: I told her a little bit how I just wasn't sure about Travis at the time and.
Interviewee: And I wasn't sure what's going on there. And she wrote in this long letter, or she didn't write a letter. Travis wrote the letter, but she kind of got on his case.
Interviewee: And and I was in. They told me all kinds of things about Travis that I wasn't.
Interviewee: Aware.
Officer: Of what kind of stuff have you talked?
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: They said if I don't get away from Travis, I'm going to become just like Deanna.
Interviewee: Which is his ex-girlfriend.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: You know, do you want to waste six years of your life waiting for him?
Interviewee: Um.
Officer: Because you can't come in.
Interviewee: He still tells the Anna, I love you, and I'm like, what? You know not.
Officer: Going yeah and and I truly believe he he he does love her stuff but does Travis had had a.
Officer: Here's what you call a player.
Officer: You know what that means.
Officer: He he tano.
Officer: But he can't make a commitment.
Officer: Portrays himself to be a certain way.
Officer: He's really not.
Officer: OK, you're portrays himself to have a lot of money. He's not.
Interviewee: He's got a lot of things. He told me the first night that I set, the first night that I met him.
Interviewee: There was a second night was at The MGM Grand. He invited me to this executive director banquet.
Interviewee: And you know, he was kind of talking about what his earnings were in the last year and how he almost made his six figures and that kind of thing. And then he leans in and he goes in his business, you have to show off your money a little bit and then prepaid legal it is people want to see that you're actually being successful, so.
Interviewee: You know he's done a good job with that about making money, yeah.
Interviewee: Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, it is those person sky were just this. By the end of the conversation they started calling me.
Interviewee: And I was just like shocked. I didn't want to. I certainly the last thing I wanted.
Officer: How did you feel about that?
Interviewee: My biggest concern was losing respect in their eyes because I really, really looked up to them.
Interviewee: And I thought I would have laughed it off. And I thought it was kind of funny, but my but I feared inside that I was losing their respect.
Interviewee: Um, so when I talked to him next, I was like, uh, you know, what do I do? What do I say? And he ended up running this.
Interviewee: Letter to side saying I just got off the phone with a very reluctant to talk to me Jody, you know?
Interviewee: And she wrote back.
Interviewee: Saying something to the effect like, you know, I wouldn't want my sister to date you.
Interviewee: Why do you kiss Jody in the dark and act like you guys aren't even together in the daytime? Things like that.
Officer: That's a good statement.
Officer: Because.
Officer: That kind of sums up the relationship that you had with him.
Officer: It seems like especially liked you. He loved you.
Officer: He wanted to be with you, but he was.
Officer: He was reluctant to make a a commitment at first.
Officer: And truly, he didn't think that you were marriage material.
Officer: And I don't know why not. I mean, I see you. You're you're, you're wonderful girl. You're.
Officer: He didn't know he was taking, maybe.
Officer: You know you're struggling, you're you're trying to to to make your way through life and.
Officer: I don't see why you guys couldn't have made.
Interviewee: I think we're just rehab.
Interviewee: Where we have very many different philosophies, in a lot of ways we would argue about the dumbest things and like he would just want me to admit that he was right and I would happily do that.
Officer: But man thing that's.
Interviewee: And I would if I should have just known better and admitted it. I eventually learned how to argue with Travis, and it's my.
Officer: Wife she's like OK, fine, you're.
Interviewee: Right. Yeah, essentially that's what it what I began to do with him. It's like the more I just agree with him, the sooner the argument gets over, the sooner we can make up. And the makeup was always great.
Interviewee: But.
Interviewee: There are so many times where I just couldn't wrap my mind around what he would. I could but but I would try to get him to do the same for me. Like there was a time when I broke down on the way to LA once when I was going to watch Chris use doing training.
Interviewee: And this was January.
Interviewee: Mid January maybe of 2007 and my my car got a flat tire. So I had at the time roadside assistance because my car was still under warranty and they pulled. They went to take the car in to change the tire and realized that when they sold me the car they didn't give me the wheel lock key. So for anti theft there was wheel locks so I had to get a hotel room. I had to get my car towed. It was a big nightmare and it was kind of hungry. It was dinner time, it was 738 and it was dark because it was January.
Interviewee: I told you that guy said, you know, there's a Denny's two blocks down here and there's a jack-in-the-box there and he was driving me to the motel. He said, is there an IHOP around? Because I really like IHOP. He's like, yeah, but it's kind of like 5 miles back in the other direction. I was like, yeah, OK, he's like, I can drive you there if you want.
Interviewee: And I was like.
Interviewee: He's like this short Mexican guy. And he seemed really harmless. And I was like, OK and he, you know, and I asked him about his life and he had a wife and kids. And so he wasn't flirting or he had a girlfriend or something. I.
Officer: Don't know, trying to be nice to.
Interviewee: You just being nice. And so I ended up telling her and he didn't.
Interviewee: Ever come on here, ever say anything inappropriate? And then he drove me back and dropped me off and that was that.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: And I got to eat and so I told that to Travis. And he didn't say anything at first, but it got back to Sky. And so I was like, why didn't you call me? And then I think eventually that was used against me to establish a pattern that I do weird things like that. So that's something we had arguments about a lot was he's like, I just think that.
Officer: He was truly upset with you about that.
Interviewee: He.
Officer: Little jealous but.
Interviewee: I.
Interviewee: Tell me one city is a little bit. He was a little bit jealous when he found out that went on those dates. He's like, but I know we're not dating.
Interviewee: And he's like, I guess I guess I am a little bit jealous, but with these other incidences, he said it just concerns.
Interviewee: Because he thinks that he thought that I would get myself in a situation where I'd get hurt because I have that sort of attitude. And I was really, since I joined prepaid, I've been really trying to break out of my bubble and do things that are a little uncomfortable as far as I'm.
Interviewee: I'm talking to people and you know, I made a resolution this year to overcome a few fears that I.
Interviewee: Really scared of. So I think that by getting into that a little then I can.
Interviewee: You know, overcome some of the.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: But his he he did act jealous. But he wouldn't say he was jealous. He would.
Officer: Just say, but he would tell.
Interviewee: Other people about.
Interviewee: What do you?
Officer: Mean. Did he tell Scott?
Interviewee: He Oh yeah, I guess it goes. I may have told Sky about that.
Officer: But they probably had a conversation with him and he probably voiced his.
Interviewee: Then.
Officer: He didn't like.
Interviewee: I know that him and Skype had a lot of fights and arguments, and it was, and I was the root of that. A lot of.
Interviewee: But I think you.
Interviewee: All in all, they especially more recently they got.
Interviewee: I think she gave him a really hard time about our relationship and one of the reasons he really wanted to keep it under wraps.
Officer: So.
Officer: I'm moving over to.
Officer: His trip to Cancun, he was going to.
Officer: When did you first find out about that? That he was going with me? Oh.
Interviewee: I didn't find. I found out about that at his memorial services.
Interviewee: It was the Monday Night Memorial services.
Officer: So you didn't know that he was going to Cancun?
Interviewee: I knew he was going, yeah.
Interviewee: I didn't know that. I think that's awesome, actually. Yeah.
Officer: Well, unfortunately, Mimi had.
Officer: Called him a week or two before.
Officer: I told him, look, if you want to take somebody else, that's fine, but I have something to tell you.
Officer: I don't look at you that way. I don't look at you as a boyfriend.
Officer: If you want to be friends, we can be friends.
Officer: And that really broke his.
Interviewee: Heart, I know.
Interviewee: I mean, he didn't tell me that, but I found out from his Bishop afterward when I talked to his Bishop.
Interviewee: And he is. Bishop did say that Travis really took that one hard and he said he took it to heart and he said he realizes that it's.
Interviewee: I'm speaking from a Bishop's perspective, he said. It's because, you know, Mimi is is of a certain caliber when it comes to her spirituality, and Travis was just another place.
Officer: Struggling. And that's something he struggled with for a long time.
Interviewee: Well, I feel I feel responsible for that part.
Officer: Why do you feel responsible?
Interviewee: Because I wasn't. I mean, I moved away, but I had participated with him in so many things that kept us both down spiritually for a long time. I mean, if I had just cut ties completely, I could probably be married, right?
Interviewee: Probably be working on my own family.
Interviewee: What can you do?
Officer: What? What kept it?
Officer: I don't understand well.
Interviewee: Moving is expensive for one, so once I was there I was kind of stuck there.
Officer: Why do you continue to go back to him? You know what he wants. You know that it's not healthy.
Officer: But yet you continue to go back.
Officer: And it brings us to this point where we are now.
Officer: OK. And I mean.
Interviewee: I guess I.
Interviewee: I.
Officer: Physically, are you saying you you knew that it that it wasn't healthy and and you knew it was contributing to something that wasn't?
Interviewee: Good and I think.
Officer: Everybody that you guys continue to do.
Interviewee: It, yeah.
Interviewee: Part of that part of my perspective now has to do with the fact that I'm going through a repentance process that I've worked out with.
Interviewee: Efficient. And he's given me, you know, certain scriptures to read and and ponder and pray about. And it just it brings me back to where I was prior to all that.
Interviewee: I don't know how much I ever really was there, as much as I am now, because even before I was baptized. Even the two days before I was baptized.
Interviewee: Four days, it was on Wednesday and I was baptized on Sunday before Thanksgiving, and it was just like like Travis and I were making out. And you know, that was prior that we hadn't.
Interviewee: Gone all the way at that point, but was just too far. And I called in that evening and I said how I I didn't. I just felt different the first few times was like, hey, that was great, you know, whatever. And then it just felt different this time. And it was right before I was about to be baptized. And, you know, I already had my interview.
Interviewee: So it was like.
Interviewee: It's just different. And he said, well, yeah, he's like, I feel the same way. And I think that's the spirit, you know, telling us this, that or the other and so.
Interviewee: I think that by driving the spirit away so much, you just get into this.
Interviewee: Pattern of.
Interviewee: I don't know, it was just.
Interviewee: It was. There was a couple times where I didn't answer his text messages and he would send me a little sad faces or.
Interviewee: Eventually he would wait, and then he would call and he would call again. And if I didn't answer, he'd call three times.
Officer: And obviously you guys kept this relationship hidden from everybody else and.
Officer: Because nobody really knew about.
Officer: Well, there were some people who.
Officer: The White talked to you and said, yeah, they continued to have a relationship even after they broke up.
Officer: Than there are others who say who are saying that.
Officer: You have become obsessive with him.
Officer: To the point to where you would go into his house when he wasn't there, or when you weren't invited and.
Officer: And he would talk to people saying.
Officer: She just kind of showed up.
Officer: I don't want to tell her to leave, but.
Officer: You know I don't want her here.
Interviewee: Oh, there were. That was must have been early on, because there were a couple times when.
Interviewee: We established a rule early on. Just don't, you know, don't come over unless, he said. You can come over anytime, but I need to know first. Yeah, he's like you just never know.
Officer: There's you ran into somebody one time, right? Didn't you run into like one of his ex girlfriends as well or or was it Deanna? Sure.
Interviewee: Ohh yeah. Well that was I was. That was OK that was there. He asked me to stay there and be with Napoleon because that was during Conference General Conference in October of last year. He took a road trip with some friends from his church to Utah and unless he's going to California.
Interviewee: You pretty much leaves Napoleon.
Interviewee: At home.
Interviewee: And so he needed someone to be there and.
Interviewee: It's like I got full house privileges. I could sleep in the bed, I could eat, you know, food and I've.
Officer: Talked to her and she said that was kind of an unusual kind of situation. She didn't expect you to be there.
Interviewee: She didn't at all. And so at first I was like, well.
Interviewee: I was like, did you give Diana any, any, you know, black over coming over unannounced because we had just set this rule and he's like, I talked to her about it. He's like, but I'll tell you what, I was on the phone for three hours with her. She was freaking out that you were.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: I think it's more that we, the more people knew about us associating, the more stress we both got from it.
Interviewee: And so, um, it was just easier to try and keep it secret and it we we didn't always do a good job with that. I think his roommates may have CC errands and things.
Interviewee: Umm.
Interviewee: But they were going to keep to themselves.
Interviewee: So we didn't worry too much about them.
Interviewee: There was actually one roommate, Officer Hepworth.
Interviewee: Ended up marrying, remarrying his his same wife and moved back to Utah.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: Yeah, I was cleaning his house one day.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: Officer told me he's like you.
Interviewee: Travis is gay.
Interviewee: And I said.
Interviewee: OK. And I assumed he was, you know, going on dates and things. He's like, no, he's really trying to date.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: I said OK and he's like he. He's desperate to get married.
Interviewee: And I said, I know that's true. And he's like, I just wanted to tell you that because I don't think he's being honest.
Interviewee: And I was like, OK, so that night.
Interviewee: You know, I confronted him about it and we had a really big fight and it was also just a bunch of things were thrown in the mix together and and then we.
Interviewee: And and I.
Interviewee: He said. Listen, I'm not dating anyone.
Interviewee: But he was very angry at Officer for getting into his business.
Interviewee: Um, he told Officer. In a very nice way. I think he.
Interviewee: I know that you have probably have good intentions, but just you.
Interviewee: Mind your own business, kind of.
Interviewee: And from then on.
Interviewee: Officer, I don't think Officer really said.
Interviewee: That was in October, I think.
Officer: You've kind of given me a really good rundown of your relationship and.
Officer: How you guys thought of each other and stuff and and I was pretty pretty close to right on with my with my theory on how you guys.
Officer: Why you continue to see each other and what was going on during that time?
Officer: Um, I think there's some other things that you're not telling me. I think.
Officer: I think maybe you were.
Officer: The jealousy probably continued even after the fact that you moved away.
Officer: For instance the.
Officer: Was it the week of the well? The first week of of June?
Officer: You took a trip to Salt Lake City.
Interviewee: Remember that trip we talked about? Ohh this year? Yes, I'm thinking back. Yeah.
Officer: You had left. I think it was like a Monday more.
Interviewee: Like Monday, June 2nd.
Officer: June 2nd morning or afternoon or something that came up late morning.
Interviewee: It was morning.
Officer: And you've gone down to Redding and rented a car. Where did you rent that car?
Interviewee: The Redding airport.
Officer: Do you remember what?
Officer: The car company it was.
Interviewee: It I don't remember the rental company, but I remember the making model. It was a Ford Focus.
Officer: Yeah, I got that from other people in Utah. They said you would show up in a Ford Focus.
Interviewee: And it was White 4 door.
Interviewee: No.
Interviewee: Like Rd trips, cruise control.
Officer: You don't remember what company it was?
Interviewee: Uh, I did.
Officer: Was it was your credit card? Yeah.
Interviewee: Yeah, I could look it.
Officer: Up. And so you took a trip and you decided to go to.
Officer: Instead of going over to Utah, you went straight out to Los Angeles.
Interviewee: Area I went to Santa Cruz first Santa.
Officer: Cruz.
Interviewee: And then I stayed the night in Monterey.
Interviewee: And the next day I drove to Pasadena.
Interviewee: Waiting for Laura to call me back.
Officer: You didn't contact her at all?
Interviewee: Uh, she contacted me finally, after I had already left.
Officer: Out there was too late. They're already.
Interviewee: Yeah. And we had plans to to do that again.
Officer: This week, which route did you take from from there?
Interviewee: I was supposed to get on the 15.
Interviewee: And go all the way up.
Interviewee: And I somehow got off of 15.
Officer: Where did you end up?
Interviewee: Um, for a while it was lost. And I'm not about sleeping in the car, so I slept for a while. I'm a heavy sleeper and I sleep a lot, so.
Officer: But you were on the 15 for a while and you ended up getting off to 15 somewhere.
Interviewee: Yeah, I I I looked at the map and I'm pretty sure I know where I went. I went, can I drive you map?
Officer: Maybe did you actually cross over into Arizona? Is that how far you?
Interviewee: Because I eventually started seeing signs for Phoenix and I was like and it was several 100 miles away still like, that's weird. Where am I going? Um, so you have California, Los Angeles.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: About a Arizona, Utah.
Interviewee: And I was supposed to go somewhere right up here on the left.
Interviewee: So the 15 kind of does one of these.
Officer: Yeah.
Officer: Goes through, let's say, Las Vegas right here.
Interviewee: Oh yeah.
Interviewee: I'm sorry, I'm, I'm.
Officer: No, that's OK. That's OK. So we'll just put.
Interviewee: Just put I just I know it cuts through zone in the corner.
Interviewee: Las Vegas Um, Saint George or somewhere here?
Interviewee: And then?
Interviewee: The 40 runs somewhere this way because somehow I I ended up on the 40.
Interviewee: And when I saw the 40 I'm like.
Interviewee: The only thing I associate with the 40 is Flagstaff, and Flagstaff is somewhere.
Officer: More flags.
Interviewee: Use Utah. I mean NN Northern Arizona.
Interviewee: And so um, and it was, I was going east and I was like, this isn't this what's going on here? I just, I wasn't going the right way. And so I.
Interviewee: Um, I've had for the last two years. I've had a car that has a GPS system and it's really good and it, I think it's Sir, it hasn't served me.
Interviewee: As far as getting a sense of direction when I moved to Palm Desert.
Officer: You kind of rely on it a little too.
Interviewee: Much too much, in fact.
Interviewee: When I moved, when I moved in with the the last place I lived in Arizona, I did not know how close it was to Travis. I didn't realize.
Interviewee: I have a very bad sense of direction and it wasn't until.
Interviewee: I began to I used my GPS the whole time I was there, pretty much just to find things.
Interviewee: Anyway, so I got back.
Interviewee: I looked at the MapQuest that I had. I had mapped WA bunch of places I was maybe going to go to Death Valley. I was.
Interviewee: Even close to him.
Interviewee: Went I crossed over twice. I think my math is wrong because the 93 goes north and then I hit the 15 again and then I got here and then I hit Arizona.
Interviewee: And then here it.
Interviewee: Somehow I got N on the 93 and then I hit the 15.
Interviewee: So, I mean, I don't know where Phoenix is and Mesa, it's got to be over here. Yeah, I didn't go anywhere near there.
Officer: So you you took this trip and you left on.
Officer: Was it Monday?
Officer: The second.
Officer: Right.
Officer: And you didn't get to Utah until?
Officer: Thursday you told me.
Interviewee: Yeah, I got two on Thursday.
Officer: So Thursday and that's the.
Officer: 5th.
Interviewee: Yeah, I think so.
Officer: It's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, yeah.
Officer: OK, so we have.
Officer: It's like 48 hours there that well obviously three days, but.
Officer: There's plenty. There's 48 hours, so this trip took you a little over 48 hours today.
Officer: I have a problem with this trip.
Interviewee: Well, I went first two. Yeah, I know.
Officer: I know you went down here, I mean, obviously.
Officer: Where we go?
Officer: Right there.
Officer: Beautiful little place here, except it's kind of smoky. You can't see the views. I was hoping to see some mountains, but.
Interviewee: He really she's not Chester.
Officer: I've gone over this trip over and over, in my mind and on paper.
Officer: And.
Officer: Even if.
Officer: There's still 20 some odd hours.
Officer: Even if you pulled over to sleep.
Officer: A couple of times.
Interviewee: Did I tell you that I got stranded? Yeah, OK.
Officer: You mentioned.
Officer: If you slept for 10 hours.
Interviewee: And we slept.
Officer: For a year and here.
Officer: It would still leave.
Officer: 18 some odd hours.
Officer: Or something else, OK.
Officer: This is what people are focusing on.
Officer: This is true.
Officer: That you took because they're saying she left.
Officer: She gets till Thursday.
Officer: Wednesday.
Officer: Some trucks was killed.
Interviewee: I did not go near his house, isn't there?
Officer: Aren't there? I pulled your cell records. Your cell phone was turned off between here.
Officer: In here.
Officer: OK, but.
Officer: The last place that pulled it?
Officer: Was here.
Officer: The next place you turned on.
Officer: Was here.
Officer: What does that show me?
Interviewee: Oh well, I began. Oh, no.
Officer: Is there plenty of time for you to do that? Yes.
Officer: And I do I believe that you.
Officer: Had come to visit Travis, yes.
Officer: I truly believe it.
Officer: Did you have the opportunity? Yes. You were traveling alone. There's no other witnesses. Your phone just happened to turn off from here to here. Well.
Interviewee: I didn't turn it off physically, but it died.
Officer: And then magically, he he found your charger here.
Officer: Is.
Interviewee: It was. It was under the Act, under the seat of the passenger side, and it was when I.
Officer: Was when you were lost, you couldn't have maybe pulled over and found it.
Interviewee: Or, well, I did finally start looking when I was stranded.
Interviewee: I wouldn't. I wouldn't have pulled over when I was lost.
Officer: This I've been focusing on this and going over and over my mind.
Officer: Why this happened? Why your phone turns off here?
Officer: Outside of Los Angeles.
Interviewee: What city is that because?
Officer: I got.
Interviewee: Towards far as.
Officer: Some cities, there's towers.
Interviewee: OK.
Officer: Well, there's towers dotted all over this place.
Interviewee: Yeah.
Officer: One tower hit here, the other tower here on the 93.
Officer: There's no way.
Officer: Somebody can get on that 15 and magically get on that 93.
Officer: Because that 15 goes right to Las Vegas.
Officer: Right there.
Officer: It continues this way. It never goes through Arizona.
Interviewee: Again, I I got off before Las Vegas.
Officer: OK.
Interviewee: I didn't get.
Officer: The 15 you'd have to go to Las Vegas and then come down South, go through the Boulder city.
Interviewee: I went through Boulder City going north.
Officer: Did you crossover the?
Interviewee: Down.
Interviewee: Huh.
Officer: You didn't think that was odd you were pressing in over.
Interviewee: Well after I figured out it was lost by then and I found. I found the 93 and then found my way back to the 15th.
Officer: And this tower here, it's not just.
Officer: Over the border in Arizona. It's quite a distance inside of Arizona that it hit.
Officer: Because there is a mountain range all along here.
Officer: And if you're on this side of the mountain range?
Officer: Pretty good distance. That signal's not going to come, not going to hit you or Utah.
Officer: Or Nevada. Or California. It's only going to hit Arizona.
Interviewee: Well, I had somehow gotten off the 15 and got onto the 40.
Interviewee: What happened?
Officer: Well, the only way you can get on the 40.
Officer: Is it after you cross?
Officer: The bridge.
Officer: Or the the dam over.
Interviewee: Down, I think I got on the 40 in California.
Officer: From the 15th.
Interviewee: Well, like, because I had actually gotten, I actually began to drive the 10 W.
Officer: Which you see what I'm saying, the confusion that we're having.
Officer: And and we'll come back to this.
Interviewee: Well, I got on the 40 somewhere over here.
Officer: In California.
Interviewee: Yeah, and continue to drive this way. Realized I was not in the right place at all.
Interviewee: And then I got onto the the 93 N and then I hit the 15 again. And then I went through Las Vegas and then Saint George and then.
Officer: That still doesn't make any sense.
Officer: And I can pull them out and show them to you, and you can go over and over and over again.
Officer: But I don't think you're being completely honest with me.
Officer: About about that.
Interviewee: Trip, I honestly got lost.
Interviewee: I.
Interviewee: It's bad timing.
Officer: Were you a trial's house on Wednesday?
Interviewee: Absolutely not. I was. I was nowhere near Mesa. It was nowhere near no Phoenix.
Interviewee: I wasn't.
Officer: What if I could show you proof you were?
Officer: Would that change your mind?
Interviewee: I wasn't there.
Officer: To be honest with you.
Interviewee: I was not at Travis's house.
Interviewee: Was not.
Officer: You were out Travis's house.
Officer: You guys had a sexual encounter.
Officer: Which there's pictures.
Officer: I know you know, there's pictures.
Officer: Because I have them.
Officer: I will show them to.
Officer: OK.
Officer: So.
Officer: What I'm asking you is for you to be honest with me.
Officer: I know you were there.
Interviewee: Are you sure those pictures aren't from another time?
Officer: Positive.
Officer: Absolutely positive.
Interviewee: The last time I had any kind of sexual contact with Travis was in April.
Officer: Remember I told you about the camera?
Officer: That camera was damaged.
Officer: Someone put it in the washing machine.
Officer: Ran it through a wash cycle.
Officer: With some clothes of Travis.
Officer: But the card's intact.
Officer: Remember I told you that card was destroyed?
Officer: I didn't want to tell you the truth.
Officer: Because I wanted to make sure those photos were accurate.
Officer: And we can pull deleted photos.
Officer: I don't care if you delete them.
Officer: Six months ago, we can pull every photo that was ever on there.
Officer: Pull the little pixels together.
Officer: Get the time stamps on them. Not all of them, but most of them have timestamps on them and we can verify those timestamps.
Officer: And I have pictures of you and Travis's bedroom with Travis. Pictures of him.
Officer: And.
Officer: It's obvious you guys are having sex.
Officer: Taking.
Officer: Photos of each other and they're dated and time stamped on the day he died.
Interviewee: Are you sure it's me? I mean that because I was not there.
Officer: It's you.
Officer: And you know it's you.
Officer: I know all the details of this case, the only thing I don't know is why.
Officer: Why did you choose?
Officer: To go visit Travis that day.
Officer: And why did you do what you did?
Officer: Why?
Officer: You did.
Officer: You hurt him.
Officer: That's why we're here.
Officer: That's why I flew up here.
Officer: Because I needed to talk to you about this.
Officer: I can just arrest you and throw you in jail, but.
Officer: I want to know why. Why did you do this to him?
Interviewee: Wouldn't hurt Travis. He's done so much for me.
Officer: There's so much evidence in that house.
Officer: So much and it all points to you.
Interviewee: I.
Interviewee: I lived there.
Interviewee: I was there for months and months and months.
Officer: I know you took pictures of him in the shower.
Officer: Just before he died.
Interviewee: I don't think he would allow that.
Officer: And the camera actually took a couple of photos by accident.
Officer: During the time he was being killed.
Officer: Really. Really. Really.
Officer: You were there.
Officer: Quit playing this game.
Officer: It's time for you to just come out.
Interviewee: And I didn't tell. No, I'm I did not hurt Travis.
Interviewee: Did not hurt Travis.
Interviewee: I wouldn't do that to him.
Officer: We have the pictures.
Interviewee: Can I see the pictures?
Officer: We have your blood at the scene.
Officer: You're here to see.
Officer: Your left palm print at the scene.
Officer: In blood.
Officer: What's going on there?
Interviewee: Well, I can explain the blood and the hair. I don't know about my left palm print.
Officer: How can you explain the blood and neck?
Interviewee: Well, because I used to bathe in Napoleon.
Interviewee: All the time and.
Officer: You haven't been there since April?
Officer: He's had the house clean several.
Interviewee: Times since then.
Officer: And this hair was not just a hair, you know, from the shower or something.
Officer: This hair was stuck.
Officer: With blood and obviously had blood on it.
Officer: At the time I got stuck where where I ended up.
Officer: There's no way.
Officer: There's no other hair.
Interviewee: Can you take can you take a hair sample and.
Officer: Like your DNA?
Interviewee: Yeah.
Interviewee: No, no. But I mean like, you know, how they could do drug tests and find out when things were done?
Officer: Can you? We can't do that.
Interviewee: Can't you measure the time?
Officer: We have DNA matching that.
Interviewee: OK, I know, but.
Officer: And that hair had a follicle on it, and that means that that hair wasn't there very long. The follicle usually dissipate.
Officer: After a certain time, it'll fall off the hair itself.
Interviewee: Well, when I would brush my hair there.
Interviewee: I mean.
Officer: This one.
Officer: You absolutely cannot.
Officer: Cannot explain that away.
Officer: You've either had blood on your hand.
Officer: And you touched the wall, or there was blood on the wall and you touched the blood.
Interviewee: Homefront. I've already been there. I've never touched it.
Officer: This is over.
Officer: This is absolutely over.
Officer: You need to tell me the.
Interviewee: Truth. Listen. The truth is I did not hurt traffic.
Interviewee: OK, so.
Officer: You can continue to do this OK.
Officer: A records check shows you that.
Officer: You.
Officer: That's reported a gun stolen.
Officer: 25 auto.
Officer: This happens to be.
Officer: Same.
Officer: Caliber as a weapon used to kill him.
Interviewee: That 25 auto was used.
Officer: Yeah, along with multiple stab wounds.
Officer: Joey.
Officer: If you want, I can show you some pictures of him.
Officer: Do you want to see pictures of him?
Interviewee: Part of me does and part of me doesn't.
Officer: Why? Because you don't want to.
Interviewee: Remember. No, actually, there's a morbid curiosity. Jody. I wanted to know how he died.
Officer: We can keep playing these games.
Officer: I'm not gonna believe.
Officer: You start telling me the truth.
Officer: Then I can believe you. But I can't deny this evidence. I can't.
Officer: The trip you took doesn't make sense. The opportunity was there.
Officer: Your pictures on that date with him.
Officer: Your blood is in the house.
Officer: Mixed with his mixed.
Officer: Not alongside, but next.
Officer: Your hair is there with blood.
Officer: And your palm print is there in blood.
Officer: It's over.
Interviewee: Could it have been my blood?
Officer: Image is not important right now.
Officer: Saving the rest of your life is.
Interviewee: Listen, if I'm found guilty, I don't have a life.
Interviewee: I'm not guilty.
Interviewee: I didn't hurt Travis.
Interviewee: If I hurt Travis, if I killed Travis, I would beg for the death penalty.
Officer: Was there anybody else with you?
Interviewee: I was traveling alone.
Interviewee: The whole.
Officer: Time was there anybody else with your Travis's house on Wednesday?
Interviewee: I was not at the House on Wednesday before.
Officer: Because that's when the blood was left on the bloody pump room was left on his wall.
Officer: I don't know what to tell you.
Officer: If you were in my shoes and I had this evidence against.
Officer: Against you, what would you say?
Interviewee: If I had that evidence against you, yeah, be pretty obvious. But I guess being in my position, I it just seems so impossible. I want to see it. I want to know. I mean, I'm not like I'm not a murderer, but I guess if I were to do that, I would wear gloves or, you know, something.
Interviewee: How could mine? I don't.
Officer: I know you tried to pass him off.
Officer: Try to get some of the blood off. Try that. Clean them up a little bit.
Officer: But you're even denying.
Officer: The pictures.
Officer: Have you been there?
Officer: There's pictures of you laying on the bed in pigtails.
Interviewee: Pigtails.
Officer: Yes.
Officer: I've got pictures of you that I've blown up and you've got the little mole right there. It's the same one. It's you. It's obvious.
Officer: I can show you some of these pictures.
Officer: You want to see the pictures?
Officer: Will that change your mind?
Interviewee: I mean, I am curious.
Officer: Let me take a break and let me go find.
Officer: I'm bringing the show.
Interviewee: I wasn't there.
Officer: Do you need to think about what you're saying?
Officer: This continuing to lie is not going to help.
Interviewee: If you don't do something I didn't do, won't help me either.
Interviewee: OK, let's say for a second that I did.
Interviewee: And I say.
Interviewee: I did it.
Interviewee: I mean.
Officer: The motive is there, the jealousy issue.
Interviewee: But I wasn't.
Interviewee: I wouldn't even say it was jealous. I mean there there may have been some jealousy there, but.
Officer: I think if.
Interviewee: Anyone.
Interviewee: I think if you know if anyone maybe?
Interviewee: Travis was jealous, but.
Officer: That's not what everybody else says.
Officer: Well, you know, he was jealous, but they think that you were absolutely obsessed.
Officer: Obsessed is the word that they use. That's the word I hear from everybody.
Officer: Fatal attraction. I don't know how many times I've heard that.
Officer: Look at Jody. Jody had done this before she got someone to do it for.
Officer: There's not one person that says anything else.
Officer: Why is that?
Officer: That's the perception they have of you, and there's a reason for that perception.
Officer: Maybe because it's true.
Interviewee: Maybe because we kept hanging out.
Interviewee: But not because it's true.
Officer: Cause of this?
Officer: I can prove you were there.
Officer: I can prove it.
Officer: But what I don't have is I don't have answers on why it happened.
Officer: Or, you know, maybe something just got out of hand. Maybe.
Officer: Maybe things got out of hand.
Interviewee: You finally had the the gun. Maybe that would.
Officer: We're just playing games here.
Officer: That gun was in your possession.
Officer: When did you report it stolen?
Interviewee: I didn't even know that there were guns until my grandparent, my grandparents, reported it still on the day that their house was broken into.
Interviewee: I don't remember.
Interviewee: A few months ago, maybe?
Officer: What did you do with the gun?
Interviewee: I don't have a gun.
Officer: They're going through your house right now, so.
Officer: Are they going to find anything there that could lead you back to this?
Interviewee: I don't think they would.
Interviewee: I mean, there's nothing that could link me there. I mean, that's pretty compelling, I have to admit, if you found my palms in there.
Interviewee: Don't know.
Officer: Do you have a pair of sweatpants? It's got stripes around the backside. Was it first?
Interviewee: Um.
Officer: Somebody seeing you wearing those before?
Interviewee: I've got so many clothes.
Interviewee: Yeah, I think I do. Wait.
Interviewee: I have a well. I have different one that zips in the back.
Officer: It's got like stripes, like big stripe on it and so well.
Interviewee: It's towards the back stripe all the way down in there. White, black. I have those are at the House it's got. I have two pairs actually. One is too small and one is just about right. The other one I bought anyway, that's too small because it was on sale and it's a good deal.
Interviewee: But yeah, they have stripes.
Interviewee: What does that mean? What is that?
Officer: Because I believe you were wearing a pair like that when that's when this.
Officer: Remember I told you about the camera?
Officer: It was taking pictures by accident. Camera was upside down flash.
Officer: Another time, camera flashed, looked like it was on the ground. Maybe it was kicked.
Officer: Pictures and it's obviously a female.
Officer: And one of them was wearing those pants.
Interviewee: Oh, I didn't even bring those pants in that trip. So.
Officer: If we find those pants, is that going to make my case a little bit better? Yeah.
Officer: Going to take a little break, but I need you to think about what you're doing here.
Officer: Is the best thing for you to do is to?
Officer: Tell me the truth.
Officer: Tell me exactly what happened, because you know what? I think your mom and your dad really deserved the truth.
Officer: They're going to be asking.
Officer: And it's.
Officer: Absolutely.
Officer: It's so important that you tell me.
Officer: Why this occurred? What was going through your mind and what caused you to do this?
Officer: It happened, and I can prove it happened, and there's no doubt in my mind, and there absolutely is no doubt in anybody else's mind who's investigating this, that you were there and that you did this.
Officer: But.
Officer: I'll let you think about that.
Officer: OK, yeah, I'm gonna go look for some pictures and I'll bring them over.
Officer: Continue this discussion.
Officer: OK, let me go find.
Officer: Perfect.
Interviewee: I'm not a murderer.
Interviewee: Actually.
Officer: So go off.
Interviewee: I just bought a gun.
Officer: Yeah, Jim, probably.
Interviewee: Found it by now. Probably was taking it from there.
Officer: So just a few photos.
Officer: And I want to be careful showing, not showing you certain photos. Please them are very.
Officer: Dad.
Officer: This is Travis's house, right?
Interviewee: Yeah.
Interviewee: Travis were here today. He would tell you that I would if it wasn't me.
Officer: My job is to speak for Travis right now, and everything Travis is telling me is that you already did this to me.
Officer: Have you ever shot that 25? Oh.
Officer: Never touched it.
Interviewee: The one that was stolen and I've never seen it.
Interviewee: Grandpa said. It looks like they told me.
Interviewee: I don't know what a 25 looks like. I know what a 22 looks like.
Officer: There's like a 22 actually.
Officer: Yeah.
Interviewee: Well, the 22 that I saw kind of looked like the ones in the Westerns where they had the barrel and the long.
Interviewee: That there was another 22 in this in the store.
Interviewee: It looked like a toy hand, so it looked like a squirt, kind of like a water gun. I don't know.
Officer: You know which pictures are showing.
Officer: There's that one.
Officer: Remember him?
Interviewee: See naked.
Interviewee: Sorry.
Officer: Yep.
Officer: Let's see it.
Officer: This is.
Interviewee: Travis would never go for that.
Officer: Soon after you and him.
Officer: Sex on his bed.
Interviewee: I couldn't have been too soon after.
Officer: An hour or so.
Interviewee: The last.
Officer: Time 2 hours.
Interviewee: It was an 8.
Officer: Copies.
Officer: Follows.
Officer: That's you. I wanted to cover you up because.
Interviewee: Oh.
Officer: That's you, all of you.
Interviewee: That looks like.
Officer: Me.
Officer: You can look at the rest of it if you want. There's a few of those.
Officer: There's a few more.
Officer: Trying out for sure because I don't want to put you out there like that.
Officer: Let's just say I've seen all of you.
Officer: And I've seen old trials.
Officer: The one that sticks in my mind of Travis.
Officer: On the autopsy table.
Officer: To show you.
Officer: Or should I?
Officer: But this one I don't know if I should show you but.
Officer: That's a bad.
Officer: Too bad.
Officer: But it's just one of the photos that was taken by accident.
Officer: And this is just a small portion.
Officer: What's your foot, Jody?
Officer: These are your pants.
Officer: No, it's off color because it did enhance it and the color kind of changes a little bit. Let's try this.
Interviewee: This is his bathroom.
Interviewee: That is not my foot.
Officer: So your pants.
Officer: It's a different color, like I said, because we had to enhance it and the color changes.
Officer: Super.
Interviewee: Bad I have both of those pants at home if these are the same one.
Interviewee: I don't have a zipper there though.
Interviewee: It's not a nine and this is a black stripe and this is white and the black is around 22.
Officer: Couldn't even recognize Travis. You've been there so long.
Interviewee: I keep your brother high some of the dresses.
Officer: This is another one that's just a copy, but.
Interviewee: It's you.
Officer: Same day.
Officer: All time stamp all.
Officer: First picture.
Officer: Let's see.
Officer: The date.
Officer: 6408 ten 5:22 PM.
Officer: You started.
Officer: Photo of you started, you know, Travis's bedroom, but one of one 3145 something.
Interviewee: I don't know what kind of problem I got.
Officer: Let's see that.
Officer: That's thought. See the spots here?
Officer: They look at different color because we use the chemical to enhance this that right there in the blood.
Officer: It's a mixture of yours and has.
Officer: That's your pump.
Officer: That your left pump.
Interviewee: I don't help you kept my life.
Officer: Nobody said that it covers up palm.
Officer: Do you have any recent cuts that are healing?
Interviewee: Well, my cat scratches me little things.
Interviewee: These are all her work. You can see this is her.
Interviewee: That's her. I've got scars. She's she's a feral cat. All these little things are her.
Officer: Enough about your cat, but.
Officer: Why is your pump right in blood?
Interviewee: How can that be my mom, Prince?
Officer: Because you were there.
Officer: That's before we used the chemical. We thought we'd get something from there.
Officer: This is where your mom pretty.
Officer: Right on the wall.
Officer: Over and over and over again.
Officer: There's no doubt in my mind that you were there.
Officer: There's no doubt in my mind that you did this.
Officer: None.
Officer: So you can go and take your blue in the face and tell me you weren't there and you had nothing to do with that. I won't believe you.
Officer: I will not believe.
Officer: Because Travis is telling me.
Officer: That you did this to him?
Officer: That's my job.
Officer: My job is to speak for him.
Officer: And this is what he's telling me.
Officer: I want to know why.
Officer: It's killing me inside.
Interviewee: That don't know why. Like there's no reason for it. There's no reason why. There's no reason I would ever want to hurt him.
Officer: There's no way anybody else.
Interviewee: He never raped.
Officer: Me. Nobody. Never. There's no way.
Officer: Anyone else could have left your.
Interviewee: Office and.
Officer: The blood.
Officer: On that.
Officer: No way.
Officer: Get that through your head.
Interviewee: If I was going to ever.
Interviewee: Try to kill somebody? I would.
Interviewee: Use gloves. I've got plenty of them.
Officer: You said you were.
Officer: You know, you had planned this out perfectly.
Officer: Maybe we're going there to just talk to him.
Officer: Have a good time with them.
Officer: Something got out of hand.
Interviewee: Even if I were there, and even if I were going there, I just have a good time with him.
Officer: But if I tell you, somebody saw you there.
Officer: Neighbor.
Officer: Do you remember some of the neighbors just don't you?
Officer: The next door neighbors. That's why.
Interviewee: I don't know his wife.
Officer: With the neighbors across the street.
Interviewee: No, I've never met them.
Officer: But you.
Officer: You've hung around there quite a bit and they know you.
Officer: Yeah, they've seen you there.
Interviewee: It.
Officer: On that day.
Interviewee: I wasn't there that.
Officer: Jody, you were there that day.
Interviewee: And even if I'm trying to think the the the majority of the time that I spent there, I had platinum blonde hair. So I mean, and I've never once said hi to them, met them, shift their hand, nothing face to face across the street.
Interviewee: When I spent time there, he wanted to keep the private, so it was um.
Interviewee: I spent the majority of my time inside.
Interviewee: Not, you know, walking around outside.
Interviewee: Except for a few times when I took his dog for a walk.
Officer: What? They see your car there?
Officer: Which party down the street?
Interviewee: No, they would see it there. I drove. An Infinity.
Interviewee: So they would definitely recognize the car, I'm sure, because, well, there are a lot of cars there a lot of times.
Officer: We're seeing Infinity now.
Interviewee: I gave it back to me.
Officer: To the impound yard somewhere.
Officer: So we have to find any evidence in that car.
Interviewee: You're free to look.
Interviewee: You can also look in the rental car.
Officer: What company? Did you rent it?
Interviewee: From I don't remember, but I can check my.
Interviewee: I can check my.
Interviewee: My debit card record.
Interviewee: I remember the making.
Officer: Model. We're waiting for it anyway, but you know all the new cars have chips in them.
Officer: Factory.
Officer: Not for you to use good.
Officer: The four.
Officer: Us to use if we need to.
Interviewee: And that's good because I was also going to ask you, I don't know if this is something that.
Officer: Absolutely nothing.
Interviewee: You can recall, but a lot of the stoplights and Mason things have cameras on them. It's been there. Any way we could back that up or you know, if I were going to Phoenix, going through that tunnel, is that surveillance? No, there's surveillance anywhere.
Officer: Unless you ran a red line.
Officer: Unless you have.
Officer: But nothing.
Officer: Beats that so.
Officer: And I have a solid case against you.
Officer: And I can present it to the judge.
Officer: As cold as as as it is now.
Officer: I don't know why she did it.
Officer: Or I can present it to the judge.
Officer: With your explanation.
Officer: With your parents explanation, have you talked to your parents about what happened?
Interviewee: I told him I was worried about stuff.
Officer: About what stuff?
Interviewee: I said that, well, they knew I was upset about Travis and I feel really bad by the way I was acting because I wasn't especially toward my grandparents.
Officer: There were a lot of times. Why are they not surprised that you're sitting here talking to me?
Officer: About this.
Interviewee: What do you mean?
Officer: They're not surprised.
Officer: They're concerned. They're they're hurt. I haven't, but my other detectives have.
Officer: And.
Officer: They're very concerned.
Interviewee: With you.
Officer: But they kind of suspected that you had something to do with promises that this well, whose parents think that?
Interviewee: That that's because I told them.
Interviewee: That a lot of people were dropping my name and I said I'm not worried about it because I didn't do it. I said but it's very much, it's hurting my reputation right now and it's made it's casting me in a bad light.
Officer: I wouldn't be worrying about your reputation right now.
Officer: I've been worrying about the rest of your life.
Officer: That means nothing.
Interviewee: The reputation will affect the rest.
Interviewee: I am worried about her.
Officer: You're going to continue with the story then that you weren't in May, saw on the 4th, you weren't at Travis House, you didn't have sex with him.
Officer: That day and you had nothing to do with his murder.
Interviewee: Those pictures are I don't know. To me, pictures are very compelling.
Interviewee: I know that they can be modified, I know they can be altered, and date and time stamps I don't know. But I I think they can be modified anything. I don't think you.
Officer: Would take absolutely special care.
Officer: What we do?
Interviewee: I know.
Officer: We actually take an image of that card. Or let's say you get a computer, take an image of that hard drive and make a copy of it. We don't even touch your hard drive.
Officer: We just work with the copy.
Officer: And that's exactly what we do with the photos. We don't work with the originals, we just make it exact.
Officer: Digital copy of everything.
Officer: Move it over so we don't touch it.
Officer: And then we analyze it and our guys are so good.
Officer: Every case they have ever done that I know of.
Officer: Has never been lost in court. It's been argued and argued and argued. There's no way that they duplicate or that they enhance with that they change or that they do anything to a photo.
Interviewee: If I'm found guilty, what happens?
Officer: You don't have to pay the price.
Interviewee: So what's the price?
Officer: Which I don't know.
Interviewee: Don't you know what the sentences are? They because they sentences that are carried for something.
Officer: Depends on your situation.
Officer: How old you are?
Officer: Depends on the type of crime.
Officer: It depends on whether.
Officer: You show remorse for that.
Officer: And part of that remorse is at least coming clean.
Officer: When somebody doesn't come clean.
Officer: I don't see any remorse.
Officer: I don't know if the judge would see any remorse. I don't know if the jury would see any remorse.
Officer: But I don't know. That's not for me to decide.
Officer: My job is to investigate.
Officer: Find out who did it, why they did it.
Officer: And present it to a court.
Officer: That's it.
Interviewee: I just can't imagine.
Officer: You have something to tell me, but you're you're just so resistant.
Officer: I know you're afraid.
Officer: But you're already going through it. Right now, there's no backing up.
Officer: There's no backing up till yesterday. There's no backing up until that day.
Officer: It's already happened.
Officer: And unfortunately, you're going to have to face the consequences.
Interviewee: I'm you know if if I did that.
Interviewee: I would.
Interviewee: I be fully ready to face the consequences.
Interviewee: I'm not really for things like, you know, I'm all for the 10 commandments. Thou shalt not kill.
Interviewee: OK.
Interviewee: But.
Officer: There is. There's no evidence to show anybody else did that.
Officer: None.
Interviewee: Well, I'm just.
Officer: Do you think we'd find somebody else's fingerprint addicted that possibly?
Officer: There's something that happens. You keep saying gloves. There's things that happen when people wear gloves.
Officer: Then we can actually see that somebody wore gloves in this case. Nobody wore gloves in this case.
Officer: Anyway.
Interviewee: No evidence, just saying that if I were to carry out something like that, I would have worn gloves.
Officer: Nobody else, nobody else did this. There's no evidence to show that anybody else did this but you.
Officer: You were the only one.
Officer: That is it.
Officer: And I'm not seeing any remorse. I'm not seeing any.
Officer: Anything from you?
Officer: To make me believe anything otherwise.
Officer: You can continue to say I didn't do.
Interviewee: It well.
Officer: But you're the kid that got caught on videotape stealing the candy.
Officer: And you continue to say it wasn't me.
Officer: I have the proof.
Officer: I have the pictures wasn't me.
Officer: I don't think you would. You would admit to it if somebody, if your own mother saw you.
Officer: Do this. And she told me, yeah, I saw her do this, you would say no, it wasn't me.
Officer: Why won't you admit to it?
Interviewee: Can I didn't kill Travis.
Interviewee: I just didn't. I did not take his life.
Officer: Did you have anything to do with the death of Travis?
Interviewee: Not I don't think I had anything directly to do with it, but I feel responsible somewhat for it.
Officer: Then what can you tell me about his death?
Interviewee: You know a lot more about it than I do. When I say I feel responsible, it's because I was.
Interviewee: It wasn't.
Interviewee: Planning to go there at all and he really wanted me to go and.
Interviewee: I told him no, and I would have if it weren't for Ryan. And there's nothing really with Ryan and I. In fact, he has been very hesitant to move anything forward because.
Interviewee: He's not sure about me, um, he said. A lot of people are talking. I just tell you that right now, I really wish this would get solved so that we can just put it behind us.
Interviewee: Maybe that's a good thing, because he's not an active tricky member anyway, but.
Interviewee: The reason I feel is because if I had, if it weren't for Ryan, I would have folded and I would have just scrubbed all my plans and spent all of my days there.
Interviewee: But I didn't. And I stood strong and he got mad and got sad and he guilted me. He didn't get really mad. He just kind of guilted me. And finally I was like, whatever, fine, we have that.
Interviewee: I feel that if I would have gone there.
Interviewee: I could.
Interviewee: I could have done something.
Interviewee: They could.
Officer: But you were there, Jodie.
Officer: You were there on Wednesday the 4th.
Interviewee: Can I ask you? I don't know if you know this.
Interviewee: I have a camera in my storage unit that I don't use anymore, but the travel is not used to use frequently.
Interviewee: We took pictures with.
Interviewee: This is.
Interviewee: I don't know.
Interviewee: This is kind.
Officer: Of do you remember taking these pictures?
Interviewee: There are many pictures I.
Interviewee: Vaguely, they were we too.
Interviewee: Tons and tons of pictures. So my save most we deleted.
Interviewee: Um, since you sent me through his phone.
Officer: He usually deleted all pictures like this.
Interviewee: Yeah, well before you got.
Officer: There any pictures like this that I found anywhere on this computer? Camera, anything.
Officer: They were deleted.
Interviewee: Well, prior to him getting his camera, all those pictures were on my camera.
Interviewee: So.
Officer: All these same pictures.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: I don't know.
Interviewee: I don't know. We took, we took a bunch the week before I left.
Interviewee: Um, we took a bunch.
Interviewee: Over the last.
Interviewee: Six or seven months?
Interviewee: We took over last year, even though we're still dating, but we would delete them mostly. Um, there were some that he sent me that I didn't delete.
Interviewee: What I'm asking is, is it possible that?
Interviewee: You know that my memory card would have been in his camera. They're interchangeable.
Officer: Is there any chance?
Interviewee: I don't know what I'm asking is what kind of memory card it was.
Officer: Just a regular little SD card because.
Interviewee: I've got one. I've got one that's like this big.
Interviewee: And it's thin.
Interviewee: Like a cracker.
Interviewee: And the one I use on my professional cameras like this size and it's more kind of like that big.
Interviewee: And the little one is really thin.
Interviewee: And it's got like little thingies here.
Interviewee: Like that and then that part.
Interviewee: So that one obviously probably wouldn't be interchangeable, because it's a cannon and it's a.
Officer: Nice.
Interviewee: The other one.
Interviewee: I don't know. I don't.
Officer: Know your cameras here, his camera's there. He just bought that car.
Interviewee: Well, the other camera that I used before, that's broken. Now it's in my storage unit, but it's still there.
Officer: And you're saying those pictures are on their camera?
Interviewee: I know what I'm saying is I had several memory cards for this camera that I don't have anymore.
Interviewee: And so I guess.
Interviewee: It's so farfetched, but I guess it's possible that.
Interviewee: My my card.
Officer: Just saying somebody took your.
Officer: Your pictures or your card and.
Officer: Is framing you and.
Interviewee: Put.
Officer: That in this camera.
Interviewee: Saying that, if if my memory cards were left at his house, he could, he would have used those for his car.
Interviewee: I don't.
Interviewee: I can explain the blood though, and I can explain the hair. I don't know about this.
Officer: I can't explain the blood over there.
Interviewee: Well, the hair.
Interviewee: There's hair everywhere, and probably every square inch of that house. My hair. You sweep it, you'll get hair everywhere. All over, around the toilet, around in the shop. I don't know what the shower because the shower gets used, but definitely around the bottom of the the sink area. And maybe I'm just.
Officer: You haven't been there since April?
Officer: There's no way.
Officer: No way.
Officer: The blood.
Officer: No.
Officer: Blood is mixed with his and that's the blood that he that he bled that day when he was killed.
Interviewee: Well.
Officer: Print. I don't know.
Interviewee: If you can check how fresh.
Officer: The blood was no, we can't check how fresh it is, but we can go by where it is.
Interviewee: OK, because I got myself.
Interviewee: When I was you.
Officer: And you're saying that that blood.
Officer: That you cut yourself with back who knows when.
Officer: Still on the wall in the exact same spot.
Interviewee: Oh, I don't know.
Officer: Where the where the bloody palm print was.
Interviewee: It was a glass that Travis had when I was using to blush. Napoleon used to give him back and I dropped it and when I picked up all the glass and I'm pretty casual about it cause I break glass at work all the time and it's not a big deal. It's nothing to be scared of.
Interviewee: I was probably just being careless with it and I sliced myself open and.
Officer: Is that how you want to leave this?
Officer: Just this far fetched excuses on why your blood is there while your hair is there like a palm print is there. What pictures are there?
Interviewee: Don't know about the.
Officer: Picture that's why you want to leave this.
Officer: I wouldn't want to.
Officer: I seriously would not want to.
Officer: You need to come out.
Officer: And tell me why this happened?
Officer: I will not accept any other excuses.
Officer: I will just move on with my investigation, with my final report, submitting all the conclusions and all the evidence.
Officer: And we can just let that judge and the jury decide.
Officer: You yourself said that if you were in my shoes, you would think that I was guilty.
Officer: We can leave it in the hands of a jury and we can do that. That's fine.
Interviewee: Would that help me at all?
Officer: I mean you can't use them accord, but.
Interviewee: Well, then there's no point in taking it.
Interviewee: I thought those things can be used.
Officer: In certain cases, in this case if you want I can check.
Interviewee: Absolutely. If I pass the lie detector test, would that help?
Officer: Me at home.
Officer: Could help you.
Interviewee: You're so weird anyway.
Officer: Travis, this is your one opportunity to talk to me, because I'm.
Officer: It's going to be a while before I talk to you.
Officer: And it's not going to be in this kind of setting.
Officer: Do you understand what's going to happen to you?
Officer: Well, we're going to, since these charges are out of Arizona.
Officer: Um.
Officer: We're going to send you through the court system here.
Officer: And then we're going to ask to extradite you 2 hours off from California.
Officer: That just means permission for you to bring you over.
Officer: Because we're stabilized.
Officer: And the next time we talk could be in a whole different set.
Officer: Could be in jail somewhere.
Officer: I think this setting is a little bit better.
Officer: That's up to you.
Officer: Jerry, I know you were there.
Officer: I know.
Officer: The Travis was either.
Officer: In the shower or just outside the shower when he was shot?
Officer: And I know somebody who was extremely angry at him.
Officer: Took a knife to him.
Officer: And couldn't stop.
Officer: Could stop.
Officer: And before you knew it, it was all over.
Officer: And then you panicked.
Interviewee: And then?
Interviewee: I've never been angry that angry at him, not enough for that. I've been so far angrier at other people, at other ex boyfriends.
Officer: And tell me who could have done this?
Officer: Who did this?
Interviewee: I don't know, but if I am.
Interviewee: If I go to trial for this, and if I'm convicted for this, whoever did this is going to be sitting very pretty somewhere, glad that it wasn't there.
Officer: And it's my job to make sure that.
Officer: And then some person does not go to jail.
Officer: But I don't see that as a person.
Officer: When I asked you always, I always asked this one question.
Officer: Actually it's two. First one is did you kill Travis?
Officer: And you kind of hesitate the limits that I have. I didn't have anything to do with it.
Officer: Then I asked you similar question.
Officer: Did you have anything to do with Travis's death?
Officer: You hesitated again.
Interviewee: That's because I feel like if I had gone to Arizona like.
Officer: Most people would say no.
Officer: Did you kill Travis? No.
Interviewee: Well, I didn't, and I didn't have anything to do with it now. Do I feel responsible? I've been carrying around guilt since I heard about.
Officer: It why do you feel responsible? If you felt responsible, it means you know something.
Interviewee: Else no.
Officer: Because it means your actions led to his death.
Interviewee: Because he always has guilted me. He's always guilty.
Interviewee: And.
Officer: So you feel somebody else? You feel somebody else killed him?
Interviewee: Well, yeah.
Officer: For what reason?
Interviewee: I don't know. I don't.
Officer: Know how do you feel guilty?
Officer: If you don't know the reason.
Interviewee: Here's why I feel guilty. One of the last times we spoke, he was guilty me about not coming to see him and part of my heart still wanted to go see him. And another part just wants to move on and.
Interviewee: Pursue this new Ave, which was in Utah.
Interviewee: And there is a tinge of guilt, you know when he would text me and he would say, hey, you wanna come over and make out or want to dig it up?
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: I didn't respond one night and I just stayed strong and it didn't respond. And then he called and called and called and then the next day he was like.
Interviewee: You don't care about me. You don't love me. You don't care. I was there all alone.
Interviewee: And you didn't want to come and hang out. You didn't want to come and keep me company. And he says it not like that. But in that tone, it's in the sweetest, sweetest way. And it's it's it's guilt.
Officer: I still don't get the guilt. I really don't. You keep explaining it, but it has nothing to do with whether.
Interviewee: He has, he guilted.
Officer: Killed or not?
Officer: He how is you being there going to prevent him from being killed?
Interviewee: Well, I kind of feel that if I had done that.
Interviewee: We could have been.
Interviewee: Movie or we could have two people could.
Interviewee: Done something more than just him.
Interviewee: I just feel like if if if there was some way that I could have prevented it, there's some way that I could have done something to stop it. And I told that to a few people they're like, well, you might have been killed too.
Interviewee: Maybe. But maybe Travis would still be alive.
Interviewee: Travis has done a lot for me and I wouldn't hurt.
Interviewee: He introduced the gospel.
Officer: Well.
Officer: I have proved this says otherwise. Show me I I can't.
Officer: I can't deny that.
Officer: I can't deny that proof.
Officer: And that proof is not pointing at anybody else.
Officer: Nobody.
Officer: Nobody in this entire world except you.
Officer: Nobody.
Officer: Nobody else was in that house that day.
Officer: Except you.
Officer: You were the only one, you and him alone.
Interviewee: I didn't even go to Mesa. Can you check? Can you check?
Officer: The GPS in the past, we will check that.
Interviewee: If it's, you know and if that comes back and.
Officer: And I've looked at the map and the way that you're saying that you travel. There is no way.
Interviewee: When the last road trip Travis and I went on, we drove to Utah one. I mean, I'm sorry, we drove to Oklahoma City.
Interviewee: Um from Mesa and one of our stops on the way was Roswell after he drove all night and I slept and then when after Roswell Museum it was my turn to drive and he's like just get on this and drive 98 point something miles and then we should be there. So I got on the road and I drove 98.6 or two or whatever miles it was.
Interviewee: And I woke him up and I said, I don't think we're here. And. And he woke him, looked around and it was just like rolling fields forever.
Interviewee: And I drove completely in the wrong direction.
Interviewee: And I'm not saying.
Interviewee: I don't know. I'm just saying I have a course sense of direction. I got totally lost.
Interviewee: I know, maybe that's just bad luck I got. Totally.
Officer: Lost. So even if you got totally lost, doesn't explain all that time.
Officer: It does not. I mean, if you went four hours here, 5 hours in a wrong direction, it's.
Interviewee: Still, at one point I wasn't going anywhere because I ran out of gas.
Interviewee: I was totally stranded.
Interviewee: I was sitting like a sitting duck and that's when I began it was it was a little bit warm and it wasn't too hot, but.
Interviewee: That's when I just. I read for a little bit. I already slept.
Interviewee: And that's when I just started looking around the car and organizing stuff and.
Interviewee: Getting trashed together and had a couple bites to eat from snacks that I had and when I was cleaning out under the seat I found my phone charger, plugged it in, powered it on. There was no cellphone reception anywhere.
Officer: So you've never seen his camera?
Officer: There's no camera.
Interviewee: I don't know, he described it.
Officer: Did you ever touch his camera?
Interviewee: I've never seen it.
Officer: OK, so there's no reason your fingerprints should be on it, OK?
Officer: Because that things off at a lab right now.
Officer: Yeah.
Officer: They're hopeful that they can get some prints off the camera, and if your prints come back on that camera, what are you going to say?
Interviewee: They won't come back on 'cause I never touched it.
Officer: That you're still can't explain the rest of this stuff.
Interviewee: I honestly can't explain the pictures, the other stuff and or the palm print. The other stuff I can explain.
Officer: That you can explain the blood either.
Officer: Because that blood is in blood. I mean that it's it's part of the print.
Officer: Unless you cut yourself.
Officer: At the beginning of the year and left your palm print and blood.
Officer: And it stayed there until he was.
Interviewee: Killed. I cut myself. It was the beginning of the year. It was before convention.
Officer: No, you can't explain it.
Interviewee: I'd have to say early March.
Officer: That palm print is there.
Officer: In blood, partially yours and partially his.
Interviewee: Is is it possible that there's just like any other way in the universe that that could have gotten there?
Officer: Possible.
Officer: Probable is the question you need to ask. Probable is absolutely not probable.
Interviewee: I understand that, but it is possible?
Officer: Anything is possible.
Interviewee: That is very compelling.
Officer: That's why I'm here. That's why I travel here.
Officer: Because I came here to arrest you.
Officer: And get an explanation from you. That's the second reason.
Officer: And since you're not giving me an explanation, I guess we'll just continue with the with the.
Interviewee: I just have no reason to hurt Travis.
Officer: You do have reason hurt, Travis.
Interviewee: What was my reason possibly be?
Officer: There's a whole history of you too, but everybody knows.
Interviewee: It I have a whole history with other.
Officer: Guys, why is everybody saying that you had something to do with his death?
Officer: Why is everybody saying that you were capable of hurting him?
Officer: Everybody says it.
Interviewee: I don't know why so.
Officer: Don't tell me that you're not capable.
Interviewee: I don't even hurt spiders.
Officer: Have you ever had any anger issues before?
Officer: Never in your past.
Interviewee: I've had arguments, so we're trying.
Officer: To tell everybody has arguments. I'm talking about anger.
Officer: Just absolute anger.
Officer: You just you lose it sometimes.
Interviewee: No, I had a nervous breakdown.
Officer: Taking that medication or anything?
Interviewee: Well, I had a nervous breakdown when boyfriend and I were arguing once and.
Interviewee: And he began to argue with me in a way that was totally different.
Interviewee: From how we we had ever argued before and he was just like every time I'd say something he was like, no, literally, you know, it was kind of weird like.
Interviewee: Every time I try to formulate a thought and I was just sad and I was crying. Every time I tried to swim with that, he would interject and then twist it and it was like the weirdest psychological thing that had ever happened. And.
Interviewee: And the way I reacted was I went into my room, was the guy I bought a house with. I went into my room and shut the door. We had separate bedrooms.
Officer: Within the 1st.
Interviewee: And I was in in his room and went down the hall into my room and shut the door and I just remember hyperventilating.
Interviewee: And that's all.
Interviewee: And I was crying.
Interviewee: And then I went to get something out of my car.
Interviewee: And when he saw that, he maybe thought I was going to leave, so he asked me for the key to his truck and pulled behind my car because he thought that because I was so upset I shouldn't drive any.
Interviewee: But I mean.
Interviewee: Other than arguments, no anger issues.
Interviewee: That I can remember.
Interviewee: I kicked the dog one.
Interviewee: I was a freshman in high school.
Interviewee: I love, love, love.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: And we had this dog, his name was Doggy Boy. And my parents until this dog that they have now, have never been able to. And I don't mean just them. We as a family have never been able to care for a dog properly as far as giving attention and make for walks and be consistent.
Interviewee: So the stock stayed in the backyard a lot, and he stayed tied up on, you know, in the shade with plenty of, you know, leeway. At one point, though, he was untied and I took the trash out.
Interviewee: And he and this is when my little brother and sister were still in diapers and he tore this. It was a diaper trash and he tore diapers all over the yard.
Interviewee: And of course I had to clean it up. And when diapers get wet and they're like Jelly, spongy, weird stuff.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: I just. I got mad and I.
Interviewee: I just kicked in with my right foot and he just moved a few feet and he didn't yell for anything but he just went.
Interviewee: He ran away and I never saw anything.
Interviewee: And.
Interviewee: I mean, that's probably an anger issue I guess.
Officer: Well, one time kicking the dog is not anger issue.
Interviewee: It changed my world as far as animal treatment goes because.
Interviewee: I just.
Interviewee: I've never seen him since.
Interviewee: And I need to apologize for that to him. I know it sounds weird, my relationship with animals, it's kind of like they're like people too, you know, they have souls.
Officer: What you need to do is you need to apologize to Travis.
Officer: You just refuse. You know I can't help you anymore if you're not going.
Officer: If you're not going to help yourself.
Interviewee: You asked me where?
Officer: I can't. I can't, Joey, you can keep talking till you blow in the face.
Officer: I can't continue to listen to lies.
Officer: Do you have anything else you need to tell me?
Officer: You asked me what?
Interviewee: Have I been up to in the weeks since I got back? What did you mean by that?
Officer: Just one.
Officer: Because I know this thing has to be weighing pretty heavy on.
Interviewee: I've been trying to.
Interviewee: Put his death behind me.
Interviewee: If I.
Interviewee: If I did anything that had anything to do with his death in any way.
Officer: It's not it to me.
Interviewee: I wouldn't.
Officer: It's not if.
Officer: But all.
Interviewee: Well, to me it is.
Interviewee: I would. I would be more than remorseful.
Officer: So maybe something you're blocking out of your head?
Interviewee: I don't think so. I mean, I tend to write everything down.
Interviewee: Tender.
Interviewee: I just finished the book the Real bus traveled and he said.
Interviewee: The true definition of sanity is dedication to reality at all cost.
Interviewee: So I think at times, you know, I may have.
Interviewee: You know, prayed or meditated upon a certain way. You know, like.
Interviewee: Like me being wealthy or something like that, but.
Officer: This is definitely reality.
Officer: We are sitting here inside of an office.
Officer: Sheriff's Department.
Officer: Then you are facing first degree murder charges.
Interviewee: What is the difference?
Officer: Going to be booked into jail and eventually you will be brought back to Arizona.
Officer: And you will stand trial.
Officer: That's the reality, and once you realize that, I think you'll be better for it.
Officer: And if you really wanted to embrace reality, you would sit here and explain to me why this happened.
Officer: But you refuse. You refuse to embrace.
Interviewee: Reality. I don't know why he was killed.
Interviewee: He don't know why I had issues with Travis.
Interviewee: If anything, he had more issues with me.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: I've had worse issues with other people. They're all still alive. I'm still friends with my ex boyfriends. They're all still alive.
Officer: You know, I've been doing this a long time.
Officer: And there's one thing that I can never get out of my head.
Officer: Ever since the first day I talked to you.
Officer: There's an old saying that.
Officer: You know, someone's just not acting right. Look into it.
Officer: You have not acted right from day one.
Officer: Day one when I talked to you on that phone.
Officer: I just sensed it. You just.
Officer: You weren't acting like somebody who used to love this guy or who still loved him, even as a close friend.
Officer: And even now, when I told you that.
Officer: I have all this evidence against you and.
Officer: And that you're facing first degree murder charges, your.
Officer: Just not acting right, Joey?
Officer: You're acting like somebody's guilty.
Interviewee: So.
Officer: You tell me.
Officer: I know because I've been doing it a long time. It's taken me a long time to to figure it out.
Officer: But.
Officer: 30 seconds to a minute of the conversation I can. I know when somebody's acting right, there's a certain way people act.
Interviewee: How did I act? It was not like I think.
Officer: It's not like TV. It's not anything like that. It's not what you see in the movies.
Officer: I see reality.
Officer: When I accuse somebody, you've committed.
Officer: A heinous crime or.
Officer: You know, something very serious.
Officer: Reality hits him and they definitely act a certain way.
Officer: And that's not you.
Officer: You act just like everybody else who I accused of doing a crime.
Officer: Who did it?
Officer: There's no other way to tell you.
Interviewee: Is it because I'm not crying?
Officer: No.
Officer: It's not because of that.
Interviewee: What is it?
Interviewee: I mean, I'm not going to change how we had.
Officer: No, obviously you can't change it. Where you're at. You're, you're, you're, since you're the way you're acting.
Officer: But you're just you're just not telling the truth.
Interviewee: Who is it different?
Officer: It's not really something you need to focus on anymore. I think you need to focus on the truth, but it's something that you refuse.
Officer: So if you don't, if you don't want to continue then then we'll just move on to the next step.
Interviewee: Listen.
Interviewee: It's not that I didn't love Travis.
Interviewee: And it's not that I don't still love him.
Interviewee: But.
Interviewee: I really needed to move on and.
Interviewee: The last.
Officer: What prevented you from moving on?
Officer: Nobody was preventing me from moving on.
Interviewee: The only person preventing me really from moving on was myself, and until I made that step and I moved back, I moved away and we communicated gradually less and less and less, and I was fine with that.
Interviewee: I haven't found the guy in the man that I want to marry, the person I want to spend my life with.
Interviewee: But in my mind.
Interviewee: Travis did and I was happy for him and I thought there was also a part of me that felt.
Interviewee: If I stay, I'm going to jeopardize that for him as well.
Interviewee: We both deserve to be happy.
Interviewee: We both deserve to have.
Interviewee: You know, being married in the temple.
Interviewee: Um, and that's where he wanted to go.
Interviewee: So, I mean, I didn't know that Mimi didn't feel that way. I had never spoken to her except at church. When I came down to Arizona, I was really worried.
Interviewee: And it was the Bishop who told me that, you know, she had essentially turned him down.
Interviewee: And the last few.
Interviewee: I mean, now that I think about it, he was really just.
Interviewee: You know, in his, in his attitude and stuff. And I just thought maybe that's just because we're just beginning to more distance ourselves.
Interviewee: Um.
Interviewee: And you know, he's still at his trip. Plan to come up here?
Interviewee: I just the reason I I don't know.
Interviewee: It's not that I'm not remorseful that he died.
Interviewee: I didn't.
Interviewee: I didn't take his life.
Officer: Did you have anything to do with?
Interviewee: I had nothing to do with his death at all.
Interviewee: At all, the reason I hesitate is because.
Interviewee: Maybe this is something that's wrong with me psychologically is, I think, of the butterfly effect.
Interviewee: And it's like you could say that the guy pumping gas station gas, pumping gas down at the gas station could have potentially because you see all these movies, these funky movies where it's like this affected this, which affected this, which affected this if he had never done.
Officer: This I know. If you've never met him, you probably still be mine.
Interviewee: That's true.
Officer: Yeah, that's because you killed him.
Interviewee: I did not, Julie.
Officer: You can't convince me otherwise.
Officer: Unless you come up with more proof.
Officer: That you didn't. But I can't prove that. Anybody else? No, I couldn't have.
Interviewee: What about if the car comes back that it was never even in that area?
Officer: Still doesn't negate the fact that we have this other evidence.
Officer: This is absolutely some of the best evidence I've ever had in a case.
Officer: And actually evicted.
Officer: A few people on less than this.
Interviewee: Well, so I'm as good as done right with that evidence.
Officer: Yeah.
Interviewee: I just can't.
Interviewee: Admit to something that I didn't do if it would help.
Interviewee: If it would help my case and give me an easier sentence, I know people feel guilty for those things.
Officer: And I don't want you to do that.
Officer: That is the absolute last thing I want.
Interviewee: Well, I.
Officer: Know what I want to do is I want to sit here with you.
Officer: And I want to go over.
Officer: Why you visited him that day?
Officer: What you guys talked about?
Officer: What caused you to get so angry?
Officer: And the details on that would happen.
Officer: And it's something that you probably don't want to remember.
Officer: But it's something that I need.
Officer: Because.
Officer: For me to finish a case completely.
Officer: I need to know.
Officer: Not just the details.
Officer: But what was going through your mind?
Officer: Because I need to present that as a full picture.
Officer: Because if I don't, I don't feel that I've completed my job.
Officer: Then my job is just be for him.
Officer: It's not anybody else.
Officer: My job isn't to speak for you. My job isn't to speak for his family.
Officer: It's just big for Travis.
Officer: And I know something horrible happened that day.
Officer: Absolutely horrible.
Officer: Something that could have been avoided.
Officer: Whether something was planned, I don't know.
Officer: Whether you planned it or whether it accidentally happened or.
Officer: Something got out of hand. I I don't know. All I could do is speculate.
Officer: And I want to believe.
Officer: That you're not this cold hearted person that could just go out and do something like this to somebody. I want to believe that.
Officer: Like a lot of people.
Officer: Things got out of control.
Officer: And before you knew it, it was too late.
Officer: That's what I want to believe.
Officer: And that's truly from my heart.
Officer: Because I sit here and I've talked to you and and I'm talking to you now, and all those conversations we had on the phone and I don't see you cold hearted.
Officer: Murder like you would see on TV or that I've seen before. Sit across from me. That's not what I see in you.
Officer: And.
Officer: Don't call it begging.
Officer: I'm begging you, at least come clean and tell me why.
Officer: Because.
Officer: I don't want to leave here today.
Officer: Not knowing.
Officer: Because it's going to follow me forever.
Interviewee: I wish that I had answers.
Interviewee: I.
Officer: You need to just let the answers come out.
Interviewee: There's just no reason.
Interviewee: There's just no reason.
Officer: There's no good reason why this.
Officer: There's never a good reason why somebody dies like this.
Interviewee: How many times was Travis stabbed?
Officer: More than I want to remember.
Officer: And I'm not going to sit here and.
Officer: Show you pictures of him after the fact. I don't do that. That's not how I work.
Officer: That is not for me to do.
Officer: But eventually, those photos will come out.
Officer: Generally we're hearing now.
Officer: Right here.
Officer: I think you're feeling the reality in the moment now.
Interviewee: No, I'm just feeling all the things that I'm going to potentially miss, miss out on with my family and I think about things it Travis's family is going to.
Interviewee: This.
Officer: Any.
Interviewee: Had brothers and sisters, and I have brothers and sisters.
Interviewee: And you?
Interviewee: Isn't life fair?
Officer: It's not fair, but this is where.
Interviewee: We are. I mean, I know that he's in a good place, and I know that he's fine. I know that he's doing great. But what about all of his friends, all of his family that are here and they're.
Interviewee: Going through all of this and I know that it's temporary, but.
Interviewee: It's so very much right now.
Interviewee: There's just no reason I would ever want to hurt.
Officer: Them.
Officer: Whether you want to is is a different question.
Interviewee: I'm just.
Officer: Saying I don't think you wanted to.
Officer: I really don't think you wanted to.
Officer: This fixed for itself.
Officer: It speaks for itself, Jody.
Officer: It goes beyond speculation.
Officer: This is way beyond speculation.
Officer: This is downright proof.
Officer: But there's no back story to it.
Officer: All I know is that.
Officer: I need a story or else it's just cold. It's so cold.
Officer: You don't look like the person that would plan something.
Officer: Like this?
Officer: You you're just not that person.
Officer: I couldn't believe other things, but not that.
Officer: But without the truth, I can't paint another picture.
Officer: And it's going to be up to the prosecutor to paint that picture. And if you want that prosecutor, and I've met him.
Officer: And you don't want him painting that picture.
Officer: Because he is.
Officer: Good at what he does.
Officer: I've worked with him before.
Officer: And you allow him to paint that picture for you.
Officer: It's not going to be good.
Interviewee: It looks like you don't really need anything, it just looks like. I mean, it looks like you don't even need a good prosecutor anyway.
Officer: So I mean right?
Interviewee: I I have to maintain my innocence. I can't admit to doing something that I haven't done. If there's any part of me wants to come out and say it.
Officer: Well, if you're gonna cop out, it's because you're telling the truth.
Interviewee: Well, that's not really caught me out.
Officer: Yeah, I don't want you to sit here and tell me a lie.
Officer: To appease me, that is the worst thing you can do for me.
Officer: Back there in that mind of yours is somebody screaming to get out and tell me what happened, but you just cannot.
Interviewee: He has done nothing, but, I mean, except for some mean words, he said.
Interviewee: People have said worse to me, or just as bad. Except for that he's never he's helped me and given me money. He was selling me his car on the easiest.
Officer: And western.
Interviewee: Whatever.
Interviewee: There's no reason why.
Officer: It just happens.
Officer: Well, I have more work to do.
Interviewee: Can you give me a rundown of what's going to happen from here when you leave?
Officer: Yeah, you're.
Interviewee: Like just today, for example.
Officer: Well, you'll probably be taking across the street to the county jail.
Officer: You'll be processed through there.
Officer: You'll be.
Officer: Sit in front of a judge at least within 24 hours.
Officer: And.
Officer: There's a warrant for your rest.
Officer: And the bond is $2,000,000.
Officer: If you can come up with a $2,000,000 bond.
Officer: Then the judge will decide whether to, you know, accept that 2,000,000 or not.
Officer: At that point.
Officer: We're going to file extradition papers. Basically our courts are saying that, hey, you have someone in custody on one of our charges, we want them brought back to Arizona.
Officer: Or at least allow us to come pick them up and that's called an extradition hearing.
Officer: You will be given the opportunity to.
Officer: Either wave it and say that's fine, I'll just go on my own free will.
Officer: Or you can find it.
Officer: And say no, I don't want to go back to terrorism.
Interviewee: But if I say I go on my own free will, of course that.
Officer: Would go, yeah.
Officer: At that point, the judge would say, OK, she's not fighting this, so come get her.
Interviewee: What if I did find? Then what?
Officer: Happens, then you would have a hearing like the little, just not a trial. Basically delays.
Interviewee: And cost people taxpayers money.
Officer: And then you'll be transformed, transferred, transferred over to.
Officer: Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix.
Officer: We'll start your course seedings.
Interviewee: And.
Officer: I've already filed these charges.
Officer: It went to a grand jury and a grand jury indicted.
Interviewee: So it's all public now?
Officer: Public works.
Interviewee: So does everyone know?
Officer: If somebody goes on tracks public record, they can check.
Officer: And they would come up with an indictment against you from where?
Officer: We don't report anything to the news.
Interviewee: Has his family called today?
Officer: They don't even know that I'm talking to you.
Interviewee: But they've been calling every day.
Officer: Every day.
Interviewee: Are you going to talk?
Officer: To them every.
Officer: How would you feel if your little brother or little sister was killed?
Interviewee: I've been wanting to call everyday too. I didn't want to look obsessive so I just tried to limit it to once a week.
Interviewee: Will I be able to see my family in Fort Collins?
Officer: I don't know what I don't know what their procedures are here at this table in this county.
Interviewee: Um, can I talk to somebody about my affairs that need to be taken care of?
Officer: You'll have to do it over the phone or they'll have to come visit you. I don't.
Interviewee: Know I'd have to be over the phone because the person that would take care of my stuff lives far away.
Officer: Are we done?
Interviewee: How long is it all going to take?
Officer: These videos, I don't know. Paperwork I don't know. I need to go see.
Officer: The procedures are different here in California than they are in Arizona. I'm used to the procedures in Arizona.
Interviewee: Wonder how nice down here.
Officer: So I'm getting help from this county and the deputies here and they're assisting me, so I need to get with them and find out how long it's going to.
Interviewee: Take um, this is a really trivial question, and it's going to reveal how shallow I am.
Interviewee: But before they book me, can I clean myself up a little bit?
Officer: You're gonna be taking the way you are.
Officer: I can't give you anything else.
Interviewee: Helps you.
Interviewee: 5 minutes.
Officer: Two hours say within an hour.
Officer: Could you 5 minutes? It could be 50 minutes.
Officer: I need to go talk to my associates here.
Officer: But anytime you feel like you need to tell me something.
Officer: You just go ahead and approach me.
Officer: OK.
Officer: Yeah, I'll get someone to come take.
Interviewee: You know, I'm not like violent and we're going to run. It's lirika. So, I mean, do I have to go? And handcuffs everywhere.
Interviewee: It's just procedure.
Officer: Whether you wrote a bad check or you're facing murder charges.
Officer: You kind of go in handcuffs.
Officer: That's just the way it is.
Officer: OK.
Officer: We'll take different precautions for different people. It's the same for everybody.
Officer: So I'm sorry.
Interviewee: Who do I ask when I can start making a phone call or two?
Officer: Once you get booked into the jail.
Officer: If it's like ours, they give you a phone. You can make it make collect calls as you want.
Officer: OK, let me see if there's somebody to take you to the rest.
Interviewee: It's not too urgent, but like maybe in the next 10 minutes.
Officer: Everything will need to go.
Interviewee: Should at least done your makeup, Jody goes.
Interviewee: I didn't hear you.
Interviewee: No, I don't want to know.
Interviewee: It might change my mind.
Interviewee: No, I won't.
Interviewee: Die, can't breathe.
Interviewee: Until you're resting here with me.
Interviewee: No, I can't.
Interviewee: Here with me.
Interviewee: You breathe.
Officer: Stop.
Interviewee: Shut up.
Interviewee: My name?
Interviewee: His.
Interviewee: Say.
Interviewee: Beige.
Interviewee: David.
Interviewee: When Christ was born.
Officer: No.
Interviewee: He knows our needs.
Interviewee: Still being.
Interviewee: Here's your shoes, don't you? Go ahead and put those on.
Interviewee: Go ahead and stop it there and just turn around.
Interviewee: Back.
Officer: She already had that.
Officer: Sure. OK.
Interviewee: Is there any reason?
Officer: For me to walk over with you.
Officer: No.
