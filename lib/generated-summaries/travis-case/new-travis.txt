 Jody was being interviewed by Detective Flores in Sisku County in October of last year in relation to the murder of Travis, her ex-partner. Flores had evidence that Jody was at Travis' house on the day of the murder, including pictures of the two of them in the bedroom, of Travis' body from the autopsy, and of Jody's pants at the scene. Despite this evidence, Jody denied being in Travis' house on the day of the murder and claimed that she had no reason to hurt Travis. Flores presented more evidence of her palm print and blood at the scene and asked Jody to explain why she had visited Travis' house on the day of the murder and what caused her to get so angry. Jody claimed that the only thing preventing her from moving on was herself, but she could not provide any other explanation for why she visited Travis' house or why she was so angry. Flores concluded that Jody had killed Travis, though she continued to deny it. She was then taken to the county jail to be processed and a warrant for her arrest was issued with a $2,000,000 bond. Flores informed her that the prosecutor would be painting a picture of her guilt and that she would eventually be transferred to Phoenix for court proceedings. Jody asked to clean herself up before being taken away, but Flores informed her that this was not possible.
