 In this police interview, an ex-boyfriend of Travis, the victim of a murder in Redding, is questioned about his involvement in the crime. The officer has evidence including pictures of the interviewee and Travis together, the interviewee's blood at the scene, a hair with a follicle, and a 25 auto gun that was reported stolen from the interviewee. The interviewee denies any involvement in the murder, but the officer presses him about his behavior and demeanor, suggesting he is not acting like someone who loved Travis. The interviewee expresses guilt for not being able to move on from Travis and suggests he may have been blocking out the memory of the murder. The officer suggests that in order to complete the case, the interviewee must explain what happened that day, and warns him of the consequences of being found guilty. The interviewee is eventually taken to the county jail and informed of the $2,000,000 bond, while the officer advises him of the extradition procedures. The interviewee expresses concern about how his family will handle the news, and the officer tells him that the procedures in California are different than Arizona. The interviewee is then taken to the jail and told that he will have to go in handcuffs.
