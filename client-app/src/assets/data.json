  "summary": "Jody was being interviewed by Detective Flores in Sisku County in October of last year in relation to the murder of Travis, her ex-partner. Flores had evidence that Jody was at Travis' house on the day of the murder, including pictures of the two of them in the bedroom, of Travis' body from the autopsy, and of Jody's pants at the scene. Despite this evidence, Jody denied being in Travis' house on the day of the murder and claimed that she had no reason to hurt Travis. Flores presented more evidence of her palm print and blood at the scene and asked Jody to explain why she had visited Travis' house on the day of the murder and what caused her to get so angry. Jody claimed that the only thing preventing her from moving on was herself, but she could not provide any other explanation for why she visited Travis' house or why she was so angry. Flores concluded that Jody had killed Travis, though she continued to deny it. She was then taken to the county jail to be processed and a warrant for her arrest was issued with a $2,000,000 bond. Flores informed her that the prosecutor would be painting a picture of her guilt and that she would eventually be transferred to Phoenix for court proceedings. Jody asked to clean herself up before being taken away, but Flores informed her that this was not possible.",
  "suitcase": "On the night of the incident, Speaker1 and their male partner were at the Katie Wade Trail near their apartment playing hide and seek. During the game, Speaker1 left the male in the suitcase and he became stuck. Speaker2 then asked Speaker1 about the video, which showed Speaker1 flipping the suitcase with the male inside saying he couldn't breathe. Speaker2 also asked Speaker1 about her drinking habits and whether she asked her neighbors for the restroom. Speaker1 maintained that her action was not intentional and she was trying to help him. Speaker2 said that they need to do their due diligence and investigate the incident. Speaker2 asked Speaker1 to promise on her son's life that her actions were not intentional, and Speaker1 agreed. Speaker2 also mentioned that the report would be released to the public and that Speaker1 should prepare for it. Speaker2 also said that they would not be showing up to Speaker1's house around her son. Speaker1 asked to be kept updated on the release of her phone and laptop, and Speaker2 agreed. Speaker2 informed Speaker1 that they will not be getting their phone and laptop back today and they need to talk to his parents about the funeral. Speaker1 was asked to swear that her actions were not intentional, to which she agreed. Speaker2 asked Speaker1 to stand up and put her hands behind her back, to which Speaker1 agreed. They discussed the protocols of being taken to jail and Speaker2 assured Speaker1 that she will be able to make a phone call once she is at the jail. Speaker2 also informed Speaker1 that George is dead and that the report will be released to the public."
